Arts & Crafts, Creativity, Featured, Realise your dreams, True StoriesKnitting With Glass – Impossible!? 


05/10/201105/10/2011 Maria 

Making the “impossible” possible is creation and creativity at its finest. Creation starts with an idea or vision – but it takes determination, endurance and resilience to bring it into being, to realise what formerly existed only in our mind.
I’ve been a textile crafts addict for thirty-plus years, and although the technicalities of the textile world fortunately 🙂 still bear lots of surprises and challenges for me, it takes a lot to stun my mind into time-out.
Which is exactly what happened a few weeks ago when I came across artwork which I would not have believed possible:  “Knitted Glass” by Carol Milne.
Cakewalk 7" x 11" x 11"
What intrigued me just as much as “How can this be possible?” was the context in which Carol sees her Knitted Glass (see Carol’s statement below). I contacted her immediately to ask whether I might feature her work on my blog, and as you see she said yes 🙂
Knit Wit - Self-portrait in knitted glass and knitted copper. 19" x 10" x 12"
Here’s Carol’s brief statement about her work:
I see my knitted work as metaphor for social structure. Individual strands are weak and brittle on their own, but deceptively strong when bound together. You can crack or break single threads without the whole structure falling apart. And even when the structure is broken, pieces remain bound together. The connections are what brings strength and integrity to the whole and what keeps it intact.
Darn - A fraying, knitted glove with a pun for a title. 10" x 18" x 13"
I found it very difficult to choose only a few photos from Carol’s amazing site, so here three more.  The last one is E.D.’s favourite – I wonder why… 😉
Bustle 7" x 16" x 16"
Quadrille 5" x 11" x 11"
Eddy 5" x 11" x 11"
Thank you, Carol 🙂

			Hi, I'm Maria. I grew up in a very creative family, and creativity is part of my normal life. In 1989 I started teaching adults - in subjects as varied as arts & crafts, languages, and office skills - and training teachers-to-be. My main creative passions are textile and paper crafts, mixed media and writing, and I'm always excited about trying or learning something new. :)

That’s one of the most amazing things I ever saw!  How fantastic!  I think you may have discovered a real ‘purl’ here (Sorry, I simply could not resist…)

WOW! My eyes were open in wide eyed wonder in admiration for this creativity! Had no idea this could be done.  It’s awesome! You should be freshly pressed. 😉 Will share with my mate as he is artistic and will enjoy this. 🙂

That glass is remarkable…I love texture and woven lines and it combines both with, of all unexpected materials…glass…Wow! Beautiful!  And her metaphor  and explanation are wonderful…”The connections are what brings strength and integrity to the whole and what keeps it intact.”…yes…

Thank you for visiting 🙂
Yes, Carol’s thoughts are not only true but also very uplifting. They remind us that every single person has a place and a double purpose in life: We don’t live only for our own sake, but also give to and take from the “pool”. There’s a constant mutual exchange as we interact with others. They pose or cause problems for us, and we for them. Individually overcoming problems, we find our own solutions, they find their solutions. “I” and “You”, learning and teaching merge, and through this great variety we all grow 🙂
