Sock Formula





Light Weight Yarn and Size B Knooking hook.


CO/INC to....
Chain 8 pull up knit stitch on each side of the chain = 16 stitches 8 on each side of the chain 8. Increase would look like this
k,inc,k,k,k,k,k,k,inc,k  on one side k,inc,k,k,k,k,k,k,inc,k on the other. 
You will Inc by 4 stitches every other row. I use a lifted increase.

Infant Inc to 24
Toddler Inc to 32
Child Inc to 40
Women Inc to 48
Men Inc to 56

Foot Length....

Knit until you have the length you need

Infant 3 1/2 inches
Toddler 5 inches
Child 6.5 inches
Women 8-11 inches
Men 10-12 inches

Short Rows

divide stiches 1/2 on a stitch holder. Other 1/2 work short rows 
Short Rows.... 

1.) Slip Stitch (SS) 1st stitch Knit to last, but dont knit last put on holder, turn
2.) SS 1st stitch, purl to last, but dont purl last put on holder, turn 
Continue steps 1 and 2 until you have 1/2 of what you started with (e.g. Infant: Inc to 24 your short rows side is 12 stitches so 1/2 of 12 is 6)

Add stitches back on....

1.) SS 1st stitch, knit to 2nd to last, knit last stitch and 1 held stitch together, pull up 1 increase, turn.
2.) SS 1st stitch, purl to 2nd to last, purl last stitch and 1 held stitch together, purl up 1 increase, turn.

Continue steps 1 and 2 until you have same number of stitches you had before short rowing and/or what is on your other stitch holder.

Knit Around

Cuff

Knit 1, Purl 1 (ribbing) or ribbing of choice for as long as you want your cuff.

Bind Off. Remember everyone is different this is just a formula.

Hugs and Kisses Hybrid Bag





So while on break I thought would design a simple drawstring bag that has both knooking and crochet incorporated in it. I had 4 testers, 2 got back with me on the results of pattern, both of which was good. I am getting ready to go back to school and want to get this pattern posted, so before the other two give me their feedback I am putting it up. If there is any problems let me know. I hope you enjoy this hybrid project. I think the Hugs and Kisses Bag shows just how fun and unique Knooking can be.

Hugs and Kisses Hybrid BagBy Ronda Chapman AKA OffTheHookArt ﻿2012

Supplies:5mm knook hookSmall amount of Worst Yarn (A skein or less)Stitch Markers and/or Row Counter
Crochet Bottom of Bag:(Ch3 always counts as a Dc stitch.)

Start with a magic ring.

Rnd 1: Ch3, 11dc in ring, slipstitch into top of 3rd chain =12 stitches. 

 Rnd 2: Ch3, 1dc in same 3rd chain as last slipstitch, 2dc in next and each stitch all around, slipstitch into top of 3rd chain = 24 stitches. 

Rnd 3: Ch3, 1dc in same 3rd chain as last slipstitch, *1dc in next stitch, 2 dc in next stitch, rep from * to last stitch, 1dc in next stitch, slipstitch into top of 3rd chain = 36 stitches. 

Rnd 4: Ch3, 1dc in same 3rd chain as last slipstitch, *1dc in each of next 2 stitches, 2 dc in next stitch, rep from * to last 2 stitches, 1dc in each of next 2 stitches, = 48 stitches.  (Transition into knooking (knitting)).  Slipstitch into back loop of 3rd chain (counts as first knit stitch on next row.)
Knooked (knit):Pull up one knit stitch from back loop of each crochet stitch all the way around = 48 stitches.Knook (Knit) in spiral (round) until you have 6 rnds.Crochet (Twisted Dc’s):Skip 1st knit stitch, Ch3 in 2nd knit stitch (counts as a Dc) then Dc in 1st knit stitch (DO NOT Bind off stitches keep them live for entire rnd.)  *Skip next knit stitch, Dc in next, then Dc in skipped stitch* .      ** to end of rnd. =48 stitches.*Knook (knit): 6 rnds., Crochet Twisted Dc’s 1 rnd*.   ** For as many rnds needed to the length you want for your bag. End with 6 rnds of knooking (knitting).

Crochet:Rnd 1:  Chain 3 in first knit stitch (counts as 1st Dc), Dc around, (Ok to bind these Dc’s off) slipstitch into top of 3rd chain. Fasten off and weave ends.
Drawstring:Where you joined bottom of bag and where 1st knit stitch happened is where you will attach crochet chain to hide joining. Make your crochet chain as long as you need for length of bag and to be able to weave it in and out of Dc’s at the top of the bag. When your chain is long enough and weaved through Dc’s clip the yarn, BUT leave a long enough tail so that you can slipstitch back down the crochet chain to your starting point at the bottom of the bag.Fasten off, and weave your ends.
Happy Knooking!

Sorry I haven't been so active





I must apologize for my absence.  I haven't been very active on my blog lately.  It's not that I don't want to, but I have a part time job, I am mother of 3 and wife that has decided to go to college to fulfill my dream of becoming a RN.  I have been very busy at school and next month I finally will be able to apply for the Nursing program.  I will try to pop in as much as I can to answer any questions I see in comments.

Happy Knooking

Another Knook Hook





So I made my own knook hook that has a pointy end like a knitting needle. And found that it made purling much easier to do and over all knooking quicker. Pictured below. 
But I found it to be alot of work to have to wittle the wood.  So I had a bamboo set that I ordered from ebay and did the unthinkable.....but it worked.  I put my hook into a pencil sharpener and sharpened away and got a beautiful point to my hook.  I just sanded it down a little to get rid of any roughness and you have to be careful not to over sharpen the hook off.

Id like to say Im sorry if any of your question go unanswered, but I am currently a full time Nursing School to earn my RN.
