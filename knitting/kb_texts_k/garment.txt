it is used to create many types of garments.

depending on the yarn and knitting pattern, knitted garments can stretch as much as 500%.

for this reason, knitting was initially developed for garments that must be elastic or stretch in response to the wearer's motions, such as socks and hosiery.

for comparison, woven garments stretch mainly along one or other of a related pair of directions that lie roughly diagonally between the warp and the weft, while contracting in the other direction of the pair (stretching and contracting with the bias), and are not very elastic, unless they are woven from stretchable material such as spandex.

knitted garments are often more form-fitting than woven garments, since their elasticity allows them to contour to the body's outline more closely; by contrast, curvature is introduced into most woven garments only with sewn darts, flares, gussets and gores, the seams of which lower the elasticity of the woven fabric still further.

extra curvature can be introduced into knitted garments without seams, as in the heel of a sock; the effect of darts, flares, etc.

various closures for the garments, such as frogs and buttons can be added; usually buttonholes are knitted into the garment, rather than cut.

many modern stretchy garments, even as they rely on elastic synthetic materials for some stretch, also achieve at least some of their stretch through knitted patterns.

close-up of knitting texture[edit] the most common texture for a knitted garment is that generated by the flat stockinette stitch—as seen, though very small, in machine-made stockings and t-shirts—which is worked in the round as nothing but knit stitches, and worked flat as alternating rows of knit and purl.

the appearance of a garment is also affected by the weight of the yarn, which describes the thickness of the spun fibre.

in hand knitting certain articles of clothing, especially larger ones like sweaters, the final knitted garment will be made of several knitted pieces, with individual sections of the garment hand knitted separately and then sewn together.

seamless knitting, where a whole garment is hand knit as a single piece, is also possible.

hence, thicker yarns generally require fewer stitches, and therefore less time, to knit up a given garment.

other tools are used to prepare yarn for knitting, to measure and design knitted garments, or to make knitting easier or more comfortable.
