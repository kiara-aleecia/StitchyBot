login | register everyone's knitting style is a little different.

there are five basic knitting styles based on the way the yarn is held and wrapped around the working needle.

the names of these styles often are associated with nationalities, like english knitting or irish cottage style, but the style you prefer has very little to do with where you grew up, or even where you learned to knit.

there are people in england and the united states who do not knit english (also called american) style, and there are plenty of people in continental europe who would scoff at the idea of holding their yarn in their non-dominant hand, as is done in continental knitting.

because of this, you will see that almost every single one of these knitting styles has two or more alternate names.

english knitting is a knitting style that involves holding the yarn in the dominant hand, alongside the working needle.

in a survey of just under 300 allfreeknitting readers, more than 60% said they knit english style.

continental knitting is a knitting style in which the knitter holds the yarn with the non-dominant hand.

because this style holds the yarn in the non-dominant hand, there is no need to move the yarn in front or behind the needles in order to switch between knitting and purling.

variations on continental style norwegian knitting the norwegian style of knitting is distinct because of the way purl stitches are worked.

this particular hold puts the working yarn in the non-dominant hand, which makes it a variant of continental; the knit stitches are worked just like the regular continental style.

this makes russian style a very tight hold that allows you to flick the yarn over the tip of the needle instead of picking it with the needle itself.

this style is similar to lever knitting (see below) with the yarn in the non-dominant hand.

lever knitting a knitting style in which the knitter holds the working yarn in the dominant hand and loops the yarn around the working needle without removing the dominant hand from the needle completely, creating a sort of back-and-forth levering motion.

many knitters who use this style hold their working needle like a pencil, which frees up their pointer finger to hold the tension of their yarn and "flick" it around the end of the needle.

portuguese knitting other names: despite the fact that portuguese knitting is done around the world and is less tied to a specific location than any other style of knitting, portuguese knitting does not have any other common names.

the reason so many knitters like this style is that it frees up the fingers for speed.

in every other knitting style, the tension is held in the hands; this gives your hands two jobs to do at the same time -- holding the yarn and working the stitches with the needles.

the shetland style of knitting goes by many names, but it's recognizable because of the way the working needle is held against the body.

because the dominant hand doesn't have to worry about holding the tension of the yarn and the working needle at the same time, this style of knitting is much faster.

this style is very similar to the style used by hazel tindall, who is often considered the world's fastest knitter.

knitting methods: eastern, western, and combination knitting it should be noted that there's a difference between knitting styles and knitting methods.

knitting style is a synonym for a knitting hold -- the way you hold your needles and yarn.

combination knitting utilizes the benefits of both styles in one piece of fabric to make complicated stitches much easier to knit.

which knitting style do you prefer?
