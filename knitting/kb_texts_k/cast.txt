[2] to secure the initial stitches of a knitted fabric, a method for casting on is used; to secure the final stitches in a wale, one uses a method of binding/casting off.

edges and joins between fabrics[edit] the initial and final edges of a knitted fabric are known as the cast-on and bound/cast-off edges.

vertical and horizontal edges can be introduced within a knitted fabric, e.g., for button holes, by binding/casting off and re-casting on again (horizontal) or by knitting the fabrics on either side of a vertical edge separately.

a piece of hand knitting begins with the process of casting on, which involves the initial creation of the stitches on the needle.

different methods of casting on are used for different effects: one may be stretchy enough for lace, while another provides a decorative edging.

provisional cast-ons are used when the knitting will continue in both directions from the cast-on.

there are various methods employed to cast on, such as the "thumb method" (also known as "slingshot" or "long-tail" cast-ons), where the stitches are created by a series of loops that will, when knitted, give a very loose edge ideal for "picking up stitches" and knitting a border; the "double needle method" (also known as "knit-on" or "cable cast-on"), whereby each loop placed on the needle is then "knitted on", which produces a firmer edge ideal on its own as a border; and many more.

the number of active stitches remains the same as when cast on unless stitches are added (an increase) or removed (a decrease).

[18] once the hand knitted piece is finished, the remaining live stitches are "cast off".

casting (or "binding") off loops the stitches across each other so they can be removed from the needle without unravelling the item.

although the mechanics are different from casting on, there is a similar variety of methods.

glass and wax[edit] close-up of "jitterbug" – knitted glass by carol milne knitted glass combines knitting, lost-wax casting, mold-making, and kiln-casting.

crochet hooks and a darning needle are often useful in binding/casting off or in joining two knitted pieces edge-to-edge.
