i’ve been a textile crafts addict for thirty-plus years, and although the technicalities of the textile world fortunately 🙂 still bear lots of surprises and challenges for me, it takes a lot to stun my mind into time-out.

my main creative passions are textile and paper crafts, mixed media and writing, and i'm always excited about trying or learning something new.
