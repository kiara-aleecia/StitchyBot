knitting creates stitches: loops of yarn in a row, either flat or in the round (tubular).

knitted fabric consists of a number of consecutive rows of connected loops that intermesh with the next and previous rows.

as each row is formed, each newly created loop is pulled through one or more loops from the prior row and placed on the gaining needle so that the loops from the prior row can be pulled off the other needle without unraveling.

can be obtained with short rows or by increasing or decreasing the number of stitches.

parallel yarns zigzag lengthwise along the fabric, each loop securing a loop of an adjacent strand from the previous row.

in the more complex stranded approach, two or more yarns alternate repeatedly within one row and all the yarns must be carried along the row, as seen in fair isle sweaters.

the lower red course is knit into the white row below it and is itself knit on the next row; this produces 'stockinette' stitch.

the upper red course is purled into the row below and then is knit, consistent with 'garter' stitch.

individual stitches, or rows of stitches, may be made taller by drawing more yarn into the new loop (an elongated stitch), which is the basis for uneven knitting: a row of tall stitches may alternate with one or more rows of short stitches for an interesting visual effect.

short and tall stitches may also alternate within a row, forming a fish-like oval pattern.

in the simplest of hand-knitted fabrics, every row of stitches are all knit (or all purl); this creates a garter stitch fabric.

alternating rows of all knit stitches and all purl stitches creates a stockinette pattern/stocking stitch.

horizontal striping (welting) is also possible, by alternating rows of knit and purl stitches.

checkerboard patterns (basketweave) are also possible, the smallest of which is known as seed/moss stitch: the stitches alternate between knit and purl in every wale and along every row.

fabrics in which each knitted row is followed by a purled row, such as in stockinette/stocking stitch, have a tendency to curl—top and bottom curl toward the front (or knitted side) while the sides curl toward the back (or purled side); by contrast, those in which knit and purl stitches are arranged symmetrically (such as ribbing, garter stitch or seed/moss stitch) have more texture and tend to lie flat.

conversely, rows of purl stitches tend to form an embossed ridge relative to a row of knit stitches.

the new loop may also be passed between two stitches in the 'present' row, thus clustering the intervening stitches; this approach is often used to produce a smocking effect in the fabric.

the merged stitches need not be from the same row; for example, a tuck can be formed by knitting stitches together from two different rows, producing a raised horizontal welt on the fabric.

not every stitch in a row need be knitted; some may be 'missed' (unknitted and passed to the active needle) and knitted on a subsequent row.

for example, a stitch slipped for one row before knitting would be roughly twice as tall as its knitted counterparts.

mosaic knitting is a form of slip-stitch knitting that knits alternate colored rows and uses slip stitches to form patterns; mosaic-knit fabrics tend to be stiffer than patterned fabrics produced by other methods such as fair-isle knitting.

cables, increases, and lace[edit] see also: list of knitting stitches ordinarily, stitches are knitted in the same order in every row, and the wales of the fabric run parallel and vertically along the fabric.

unlike woven fabrics, where strands usually run straight horizontally and vertically, yarn that has been knitted follows a looped path along its row, as with the red strand in the diagram at left, in which the loops of one row have all been pulled through the loops of the row below it.

on the right side, the visible portions of the loops are the verticals connecting two rows which are arranged in a grid of v shapes.

because the yarn holding rows together is all on the front, and the yarn holding side-by-side stitches together is all on the back, stockinette fabric has a strong tendency to curl toward the front on the top and bottom, and toward the back on the left and right side.

stitches can be worked from either side, and various patterns are created by mixing regular knit stitches with the "wrong side" stitches, known as purl stitches, either in columns (ribbing), rows (garter, welting), or more complex patterns.

close-up of knitting texture[edit] the most common texture for a knitted garment is that generated by the flat stockinette stitch—as seen, though very small, in machine-made stockings and t-shirts—which is worked in the round as nothing but knit stitches, and worked flat as alternating rows of knit and purl.

changing the order of stitches from one row to the next, usually with the help of a cable needle or stitch holder, is key to cable knitting, producing an endless variety of cables, honeycombs, ropes, and aran sweater patterning.

some yarns are dyed to be either variegated (changing color every few stitches in a random fashion) or self-striping (changing every few rows).

otherwise, knitters can alternate skeins every few rows to help the dye lots blend together easier.

the thickness or weight of the yarn is a significant factor in determining the gauge/tension, i.e., how many stitches and rows are required to cover a given area for a given stitch pattern.

julia knitted a square of ten stitches and ten rows in stockinette stitch using knitting needles that were 6.5 centimeters (2½") in diameter and 3.5 meters (11'6") long.

for large or complex knitting patterns, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of which stitch should be knit in a particular way; therefore, several tools have been developed to identify the number of a particular row or stitch, including circular stitch markers, hanging markers, extra yarn and row counters.

in russian knitting, it is common to slip the first stitch of every row.

fair isle[edit] main article: fair isle (technique) a method by which many different yarns are used throughout the row and when not being used are floated on the wrong side of the piece.

[30][31] short row[edit] main article: short row (knitting) in short row knitting, the work is turned before a row is fully knitted.

german short row[edit] in german short rows, the work is turned and the last stitch worked is slipped purlwise with yarn in front to the right needle.

japanese short row[edit] in japanese short rows, a locking stitch marker is used to hold the loop of the working yarn at the turning point.

japanese short rows usually result in tidier turning points with less extraneous yarn bulk compared to german short rows and the wrap and turn technique.

horizontal striping (welting) is also possible, by alternating rows of knit and purl stitches.

checkerboard patterns (basketweave) are also possible, the smallest of which is known as seed/moss stitch: the stitches alternate between knit and purl in every wale and along every row.

fabrics in which each knitted row is followed by a purled row, such as in stockinette/stocking stitch, have a tendency to curl—top and bottom curl toward the front (or knitted side) while the sides curl toward the back (or purled side); by contrast, those in which knit and purl stitches are arranged symmetrically (such as ribbing, garter stitch or seed/moss stitch) have more texture and tend to lie flat.

conversely, rows of purl stitches tend to form an embossed ridge relative to a row of knit stitches.

the new loop may also be passed between two stitches in the 'present' row, thus clustering the intervening stitches; this approach is often used to produce a smocking effect in the fabric.

the merged stitches need not be from the same row; for example, a tuck can be formed by knitting stitches together from two different rows, producing a raised horizontal welt on the fabric.

not every stitch in a row need be knitted; some may be 'missed' (unknitted and passed to the active needle) and knitted on a subsequent row.

for example, a stitch slipped for one row before knitting would be roughly twice as tall as its knitted counterparts.

mosaic knitting is a form of slip-stitch knitting that knits alternate colored rows and uses slip stitches to form patterns; mosaic-knit fabrics tend to be stiffer than patterned fabrics produced by other methods such as fair-isle knitting.

cables, increases, and lace[edit] see also: list of knitting stitches ordinarily, stitches are knitted in the same order in every row, and the wales of the fabric run parallel and vertically along the fabric.

unlike woven fabrics, where strands usually run straight horizontally and vertically, yarn that has been knitted follows a looped path along its row, as with the red strand in the diagram at left, in which the loops of one row have all been pulled through the loops of the row below it.

on the right side, the visible portions of the loops are the verticals connecting two rows which are arranged in a grid of v shapes.

because the yarn holding rows together is all on the front, and the yarn holding side-by-side stitches together is all on the back, stockinette fabric has a strong tendency to curl toward the front on the top and bottom, and toward the back on the left and right side.

stitches can be worked from either side, and various patterns are created by mixing regular knit stitches with the "wrong side" stitches, known as purl stitches, either in columns (ribbing), rows (garter, welting), or more complex patterns.

close-up of knitting texture[edit] the most common texture for a knitted garment is that generated by the flat stockinette stitch—as seen, though very small, in machine-made stockings and t-shirts—which is worked in the round as nothing but knit stitches, and worked flat as alternating rows of knit and purl.

changing the order of stitches from one row to the next, usually with the help of a cable needle or stitch holder, is key to cable knitting, producing an endless variety of cables, honeycombs, ropes, and aran sweater patterning.

some yarns are dyed to be either variegated (changing color every few stitches in a random fashion) or self-striping (changing every few rows).

otherwise, knitters can alternate skeins every few rows to help the dye lots blend together easier.

the thickness or weight of the yarn is a significant factor in determining the gauge/tension, i.e., how many stitches and rows are required to cover a given area for a given stitch pattern.

julia knitted a square of ten stitches and ten rows in stockinette stitch using knitting needles that were 6.5 centimeters (2½") in diameter and 3.5 meters (11'6") long.

for large or complex knitting patterns, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of which stitch should be knit in a particular way; therefore, several tools have been developed to identify the number of a particular row or stitch, including circular stitch markers, hanging markers, extra yarn and row counters.

in russian knitting, it is common to slip the first stitch of every row.

fair isle[edit] main article: fair isle (technique) a method by which many different yarns are used throughout the row and when not being used are floated on the wrong side of the piece.

[30][31] short row[edit] main article: short row (knitting) in short row knitting, the work is turned before a row is fully knitted.

german short row[edit] in german short rows, the work is turned and the last stitch worked is slipped purlwise with yarn in front to the right needle.

japanese short row[edit] in japanese short rows, a locking stitch marker is used to hold the loop of the working yarn at the turning point.

japanese short rows usually result in tidier turning points with less extraneous yarn bulk compared to german short rows and the wrap and turn technique.

knitting creates stitches : loops of yarn in a row , either flat or in the round ( tubular ).

knitted fabric consists of a number of consecutive rows of connected loops that intermesh with the next and previous rows .

as each row is formed , each newly created loop is pulled through one or more loops from the prior row and placed on the gaining needle so that the loops from the prior row can be pulled off the other needle without unraveling .

can be obtained with short rows or by increasing or decreasing the number of stitches .

parallel yarns zigzag lengthwise along the fabric , each loop securing a loop of an adjacent strand from the previous row .

in the more complex stranded approach , two or more yarns alternate repeatedly within one row and all the yarns must be carried along the row , as seen in fair isle sweaters .

the lower red course is knit into the white row below it and is itself knit on the next row ; this produces ' stockinette ' stitch .

the upper red course is purled into the row below and then is knit , consistent with ' garter ' stitch .

individual stitches , or rows of stitches , may be made taller by drawing more yarn into the new loop ( an elongated stitch ), which is the basis for uneven knitting : a row of tall stitches may alternate with one or more rows of short stitches for an interesting visual effect .

short and tall stitches may also alternate within a row , forming a fish - like oval pattern .

in the simplest of hand - knitted fabrics , every row of stitches are all knit ( or all purl ); this creates a garter stitch fabric .

alternating rows of all knit stitches and all purl stitches creates a stockinette pattern / stocking stitch .

horizontal striping ( welting ) is also possible , by alternating rows of knit and purl stitches .
