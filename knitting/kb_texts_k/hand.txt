knitting may be done by hand or by machine.

during knitting, the active stitches are secured mechanically, either from individual hooks (in knitting machines) or from a knitting needle or frame in hand-knitting.

[3] since a typical piece of knitted fabric may have hundreds of wales, warp knitting is typically done by machine, whereas weft knitting is done by both hand and machine.

in the simplest of hand-knitted fabrics, every row of stitches are all knit (or all purl); this creates a garter stitch fabric.

hand-knitters generally produce right-plaited stitches by knitting or purling through the back loops, i.e., passing the needle through the initial stitch in an unusual way, but wrapping the yarn as usual.

by contrast, the left-plaited stitch is generally formed by hand-knitters by wrapping the yarn in the opposite way, rather than by any change in the needle.

[16] with the invention in 1589 of the stocking frame, an early form of knitting machine, knitting "by hand" became a craft used by country people with easy access to fiber.

similar to quilting, spinning, and needlepoint, hand knitting became a leisure activity for the wealthy.

english roman catholic priest and former anglican bishop, richard rutt, authored a history of the craft in a history of hand knitting (batsford, 1987).

hand knitting process[edit] a woman in the process of hand knitting (1904) there are many hundreds of different knitting stitches used by hand knitters.

a piece of hand knitting begins with the process of casting on, which involves the initial creation of the stitches on the needle.

most western-style hand knitters follow either the english style (in which the yarn is held in the right hand) or the continental style (in which the yarn is held in the left hand).

[18] once the hand knitted piece is finished, the remaining live stitches are "cast off".

in hand knitting certain articles of clothing, especially larger ones like sweaters, the final knitted garment will be made of several knitted pieces, with individual sections of the garment hand knitted separately and then sewn together.

seamless knitting, where a whole garment is hand knit as a single piece, is also possible.

elizabeth zimmermann is probably the best-known proponent of seamless or circular hand knitting techniques.

yarn for hand-knitting is usually sold as balls or skeins (hanks), and it may also be wound on spools or cones.

this transformation may be done by hand, or with a device known as a ballwinder.

a yarn's usefulness for a knitting project is judged by several factors, such as its loft (its ability to trap air), its resilience (elasticity under tension), its washability and colorfastness, its hand (its feel, particularly softness vs. scratchiness), its durability against abrasion, its resistance to pilling, its hairiness (fuzziness), its tendency to twist or untwist, its overall weight and drape, its blocking and felting qualities, its comfort (breathability, moisture absorption, wicking properties) and of course its look, which includes its color, sheen, smoothness and ornamental features.

the resilience and propensity to (un)twist are general properties that affect the ease of hand-knitting.

dyeing may be done industrially, by hand or even hand-painted onto the yarn.

ancillary tools[edit] some ancillary tools, also called notions, used by hand-knitters.

various tools have been developed to make hand-knitting easier.

another problem is that too much knitting may lead to hand and wrist troubles; for this, special stress-relieving gloves are available.

knitting styles/holds[edit] continental/german style[edit] main article: continental knitting continental knitting is achieved by holding the yarn in your left hand for both knitting and purling.

now wrap the yarn around the index finger on that left hand, so it is coming over the top of your finger and back around underneath it and on top of your middle finger.

you will wind up with your index finger very close to the back of your left-hand needle.

[46] health benefits[edit] the earliest image of circular knitting, from the 15th century ad buxtehude altarpiece studies have shown that hand knitting, along with other forms of needlework, provide several significant health benefits.

these studies have found the rhythmic and repetitive action of hand knitting can help prevent and manage stress, pain and depression, which in turn strengthens the body's immune system,[47] as well as create a relaxation response in the body which can decrease blood pressure, heart rate, help prevent illness, and have a calming effect.

pain specialists have also found that hand knitting changes brain chemistry, resulting in an increase in "feel good" hormones (i.e.

but when it comes to which hand you hold your yarn in, the knitting world is pretty divided.

there are people in england and the united states who do not knit english (also called american) style, and there are plenty of people in continental europe who would scoff at the idea of holding their yarn in their non-dominant hand, as is done in continental knitting.

english knitting is a knitting style that involves holding the yarn in the dominant hand, alongside the working needle.

continental knitting is a knitting style in which the knitter holds the yarn with the non-dominant hand.

many knitters find this method a lot quicker, and crocheters who are learning how to knit often find continental feels more natural in their hands.

because this style holds the yarn in the non-dominant hand, there is no need to move the yarn in front or behind the needles in order to switch between knitting and purling.

instead, the yarn is either placed above or below the needle in the non-dominant hand.

this particular hold puts the working yarn in the non-dominant hand, which makes it a variant of continental; the knit stitches are worked just like the regular continental style.

the only distinction with russian knitting is that the working yarn is wrapped around the pointer finger of the non-dominant hand, very close to where it comes out from the fabric as the leading leg.

this style is similar to lever knitting (see below) with the yarn in the non-dominant hand.

lever knitting a knitting style in which the knitter holds the working yarn in the dominant hand and loops the yarn around the working needle without removing the dominant hand from the needle completely, creating a sort of back-and-forth levering motion.

portuguese knitting is an especially unique knitting hold because the tension of the yarn is not held in the hands at all.

in every other knitting style, the tension is held in the hands; this gives your hands two jobs to do at the same time -- holding the yarn and working the stitches with the needles.

this technique is also great for helping with knitting pain because so much of the stress in the hands comes from holding the yarn.

because the dominant hand doesn't have to worry about holding the tension of the yarn and the working needle at the same time, this style of knitting is much faster.

knitting method, on the other hand, has to do with the way you form the stitches themselves.
