there are usually many active stitches on the knitting needle at one time.

as each row is formed, each newly created loop is pulled through one or more loops from the prior row and placed on the gaining needle so that the loops from the prior row can be pulled off the other needle without unraveling.

differences in yarn (varying in fibre type, weight, uniformity and twist), needle size, and stitch type allow for a variety of knitted fabrics with different properties, including color, texture, thickness, heat retention, water resistance, and integrity.

during knitting, the active stitches are secured mechanically, either from individual hooks (in knitting machines) or from a knitting needle or frame in hand-knitting.

not every stitch in a row need be knitted; some may be 'missed' (unknitted and passed to the active needle) and knitted on a subsequent row.

when knitting, a pair of long needles is needed to be able to form the loops from one set of loop to another through the needles.

hand-knitters generally produce right-plaited stitches by knitting or purling through the back loops, i.e., passing the needle through the initial stitch in an unusual way, but wrapping the yarn as usual.

by contrast, the left-plaited stitch is generally formed by hand-knitters by wrapping the yarn in the opposite way, rather than by any change in the needle.

[14] nålebinding (danish: literally "binding with a needle" or "needle-binding") is a fabric creation technique predating both knitting and crochet.

similar to quilting, spinning, and needlepoint, hand knitting became a leisure activity for the wealthy.

adding a "slip stitch" (where a loop is passed from one needle to the other) allows for a wide range of textures, including heel and linen stitches as well as a number of more complicated patterns.

combining certain increases, which can create small eyelet holes in the resulting fabric, with assorted decreases is key to creating knitted lace, a very open fabric resembling needle or bobbin lace.

changing the order of stitches from one row to the next, usually with the help of a cable needle or stitch holder, is key to cable knitting, producing an endless variety of cables, honeycombs, ropes, and aran sweater patterning.

a piece of hand knitting begins with the process of casting on, which involves the initial creation of the stitches on the needle.

there are various methods employed to cast on, such as the "thumb method" (also known as "slingshot" or "long-tail" cast-ons), where the stitches are created by a series of loops that will, when knitted, give a very loose edge ideal for "picking up stitches" and knitting a border; the "double needle method" (also known as "knit-on" or "cable cast-on"), whereby each loop placed on the needle is then "knitted on", which produces a firmer edge ideal on its own as a border; and many more.

there are also different ways to insert the needle into the stitch.

casting (or "binding") off loops the stitches across each other so they can be removed from the needle without unravelling the item.

smaller items, such as socks and hats, are usually knit in one piece on double-pointed needles or circular needles.

hats in particular can be started "top down" on double pointed needles with the increases added until the preferred size is achieved, switching to an appropriate circular needle when enough stitches have been added.

skeins and balls are generally sold with a yarn-band, a label that describes the yarn's weight, length, dye lot, fiber content, washing instructions, suggested needle size, likely gauge/tension, etc.

thicker yarns generally require thicker knitting needles, whereas thinner yarns may be knit with thick or thin needles.

in very simple cases, knitting can be done without tools, using only the fingers to do these tasks; however, knitting is usually carried out using tools such as knitting needles, knitting machines or rigid frames.

needles[edit] main article: knitting needle knitting needles in a variety of sizes and materials.

there are three basic types of knitting needles (also called "knitting pins").

such needles are usually 10–16 inches (250–410 mm) long but, due to the compressibility of knitted fabrics, may be used to knit pieces significantly wider.

the most important property of needles is their diameter, which ranges from below 2 to 25 mm (roughly 1 inch).

thus, a simple way to change gauge/tension is to use different needles, which is the basis of uneven knitting.

although the diameter of the knitting needle is often measured in millimeters, there are several measurement systems, particularly those specific to the united states, the united kingdom and japan; a conversion table is given at knitting needle.

such knitting needles may be made out of any materials, but the most common materials are metals, wood, bamboo, and plastic.

different materials have different frictions and grip the yarn differently; slick needles such as metallic needles are useful for swift knitting, whereas rougher needles such as bamboo offer more friction and are therefore less prone to dropping stitches.

needles with lighted tips have been sold to allow knitters to knit in the dark.

double-pointed knitting needles in various materials and sizes.

the second type of knitting needles are straight, double-pointed knitting needles (also called "dpns").

double-pointed needles are tapered at both ends, which allows them to be knit from either end.

dpns are typically used for circular knitting, especially smaller tube-shaped pieces such as sleeves, collars, and socks; usually one needle is active while the others hold the remaining active stitches.

the third needle type consists of circular needles, which are long, flexible double-pointed needles.

circular needles are typically 24-60 inches long, and are usually used singly or in pairs; again, the width of the knitted piece may be significantly longer than the length of the circular needle.

interchangeable needles are a subset of circular needles.

they are kits consist of pairs of needles with usually nylon cables or cords.

the cables/cords are screwed into the needles, allowing the knitter to have both flexible straight needles or circular needles.

this also allows the knitter to change the diameter and length of the needles as needed.

the needles must be screwed on tightly, otherwise yarn can snag and become damaged.

circular knitting needles in different lengths, materials and sizes, including plastic, aluminum, steel and nickel-plated brassthe ability to work from either end of one needle is convenient in several types of knitting, such as slip-stitch versions of double knitting.

circular needles may be used for flat or circular knitting.

cable needles are a special case of dpns, although they are usually not straight, but dimpled in the middle.

cable needles are typically very short (a few inches), and are used to hold stitches temporarily while others are being knitted.

when in use, the cable needle is used at the same time as two regular needles.

at specific points indicated by the knitting pattern, the cable needle is moved, the stitches on it are worked by the other needles, then the cable needle is turned around to a different position to create the cable twist.

cable needles cable needles are a specific design, and are used to create the twisting motif of a knitted cable.

largest circular knitting needles[edit] the largest aluminum circular knitting needles on record are size us 150 and are nearly 7 feet tall.

record[edit] julia hopson with world-record 3.5 meter (11'6") long knitting needles the current holder of the guinness world record for knitting with the largest knitting needles is julia hopson[24] of penzance in cornwall.

julia knitted a square of ten stitches and ten rows in stockinette stitch using knitting needles that were 6.5 centimeters (2½") in diameter and 3.5 meters (11'6") long.

starting from the bottom right are two crochet hooks, two stitch holders (like big blunt safety pins), and two cable needles in pink and green.

on the left are a pair of scissors, a yarn needle, green and blue stitch markers, and two orange point protectors.

at the top left are two blue point protectors, one on a red needle.

tools for measuring needle diameter and yarn properties have been discussed above, as well as the yarn swift, ballwinder and "yarntainers".

crochet hooks and a darning needle are often useful in binding/casting off or in joining two knitted pieces edge-to-edge.

the darning needle is used in duplicate stitch (also known as swiss darning).

a second potential difficulty is that the knitted piece will slide off the tapered end of the needles when unattended; this is prevented by "point protectors" that cap the tapered ends.

in traditional shetland knitting a special belt is often used to support the end of one needle allowing the knitting greater speed.

finally, there are sundry bags and containers for holding knitting, yarns and needles.

norwegian style[edit] main article: norwegian knitting while knit stitches are worked as in the classic continental style, the purl is worked by leaving the yarn at back and moving the needle.

[25] russian style[edit] another variation on continental knitting, this style is achieved by "picking" up the yarn by moving the needle head into it.

you will wind up with your index finger very close to the back of your left-hand needle.

mega knitting[edit] mega knitting is a term recently coined and relates to the use of knitting needles greater than or equal to half an inch in diameter.

mega knitting uses the same stitches and techniques as conventional knitting, except that hooks are carved into the ends of the needles.

the hooked needles greatly enhance control of the work, catching the stitches and preventing them from slipping off.

it was the development of the knitting machine that introduced hooked needles and enabled faultless, automated knitting.

the hook catches the loop of yarn as each stitch is knitted, meaning that wrists and fingers do not have to work so hard and there is less chance of stitches slipping off the needle.

[26] micro knitting[edit] micro knitting or miniature knitting uses extremely fine threads and needles.

anthea crome created 14 tiny sweaters used in the stop motion animated film coraline and has made objects at 60 or 80 stitches per inch, making her own needles from fine surgical steel wire.

annelies de kort has knitted on an even smaller scale and has used needles of 0.4mm.

german short row[edit] in german short rows, the work is turned and the last stitch worked is slipped purlwise with yarn in front to the right needle.

finally, the working yarn is pulled over the top of the needle to the back, which rotates the stitch on the needle so that it tips backwards, forming what appears to be a double-stitch, sometimes referred to as a “german double stitch”.

the working yarn stays to the back for the next stitch if it is to be knitted, or rotated below the right needle and pulled to the front, if it is to be purled, both of which maintain the proper (“tipped back”) orientation of the german double stitch.

[46] health benefits[edit] the earliest image of circular knitting, from the 15th century ad buxtehude altarpiece studies have shown that hand knitting, along with other forms of needlework, provide several significant health benefits.

^ a b c a wale, according to knitting technology: a comprehensive handbook and practical guide, is "a predominantly vertical column of needle loops generally produced by the same needles at successive (not necessarily all) knitting cycles.

a wale starts as soon as an empty needle starts to knit" (spencer 1989:17).

there are usually many active stitches on the knitting needle at one time.

as each row is formed, each newly created loop is pulled through one or more loops from the prior row and placed on the gaining needle so that the loops from the prior row can be pulled off the other needle without unraveling.

differences in yarn (varying in fibre type, weight, uniformity and twist), needle size, and stitch type allow for a variety of knitted fabrics with different properties, including color, texture, thickness, heat retention, water resistance, and integrity.

during knitting, the active stitches are secured mechanically, either from individual hooks (in knitting machines) or from a knitting needle or frame in hand-knitting.

not every stitch in a row need be knitted; some may be 'missed' (unknitted and passed to the active needle) and knitted on a subsequent row.

when knitting, a pair of long needles is needed to be able to form the loops from one set of loop to another through the needles.

hand-knitters generally produce right-plaited stitches by knitting or purling through the back loops, i.e., passing the needle through the initial stitch in an unusual way, but wrapping the yarn as usual.

by contrast, the left-plaited stitch is generally formed by hand-knitters by wrapping the yarn in the opposite way, rather than by any change in the needle.

[14] nålebinding (danish: literally "binding with a needle" or "needle-binding") is a fabric creation technique predating both knitting and crochet.

similar to quilting, spinning, and needlepoint, hand knitting became a leisure activity for the wealthy.

adding a "slip stitch" (where a loop is passed from one needle to the other) allows for a wide range of textures, including heel and linen stitches as well as a number of more complicated patterns.

combining certain increases, which can create small eyelet holes in the resulting fabric, with assorted decreases is key to creating knitted lace, a very open fabric resembling needle or bobbin lace.

changing the order of stitches from one row to the next, usually with the help of a cable needle or stitch holder, is key to cable knitting, producing an endless variety of cables, honeycombs, ropes, and aran sweater patterning.

a piece of hand knitting begins with the process of casting on, which involves the initial creation of the stitches on the needle.

there are various methods employed to cast on, such as the "thumb method" (also known as "slingshot" or "long-tail" cast-ons), where the stitches are created by a series of loops that will, when knitted, give a very loose edge ideal for "picking up stitches" and knitting a border; the "double needle method" (also known as "knit-on" or "cable cast-on"), whereby each loop placed on the needle is then "knitted on", which produces a firmer edge ideal on its own as a border; and many more.

there are also different ways to insert the needle into the stitch.

casting (or "binding") off loops the stitches across each other so they can be removed from the needle without unravelling the item.

smaller items, such as socks and hats, are usually knit in one piece on double-pointed needles or circular needles.

hats in particular can be started "top down" on double pointed needles with the increases added until the preferred size is achieved, switching to an appropriate circular needle when enough stitches have been added.

skeins and balls are generally sold with a yarn-band, a label that describes the yarn's weight, length, dye lot, fiber content, washing instructions, suggested needle size, likely gauge/tension, etc.

thicker yarns generally require thicker knitting needles, whereas thinner yarns may be knit with thick or thin needles.

in very simple cases, knitting can be done without tools, using only the fingers to do these tasks; however, knitting is usually carried out using tools such as knitting needles, knitting machines or rigid frames.

needles[edit] main article: knitting needle knitting needles in a variety of sizes and materials.

there are three basic types of knitting needles (also called "knitting pins").

such needles are usually 10–16 inches (250–410 mm) long but, due to the compressibility of knitted fabrics, may be used to knit pieces significantly wider.

the most important property of needles is their diameter, which ranges from below 2 to 25 mm (roughly 1 inch).

thus, a simple way to change gauge/tension is to use different needles, which is the basis of uneven knitting.

although the diameter of the knitting needle is often measured in millimeters, there are several measurement systems, particularly those specific to the united states, the united kingdom and japan; a conversion table is given at knitting needle.

such knitting needles may be made out of any materials, but the most common materials are metals, wood, bamboo, and plastic.

different materials have different frictions and grip the yarn differently; slick needles such as metallic needles are useful for swift knitting, whereas rougher needles such as bamboo offer more friction and are therefore less prone to dropping stitches.

needles with lighted tips have been sold to allow knitters to knit in the dark.

double-pointed knitting needles in various materials and sizes.

the second type of knitting needles are straight, double-pointed knitting needles (also called "dpns").

double-pointed needles are tapered at both ends, which allows them to be knit from either end.

dpns are typically used for circular knitting, especially smaller tube-shaped pieces such as sleeves, collars, and socks; usually one needle is active while the others hold the remaining active stitches.

the third needle type consists of circular needles, which are long, flexible double-pointed needles.

circular needles are typically 24-60 inches long, and are usually used singly or in pairs; again, the width of the knitted piece may be significantly longer than the length of the circular needle.

interchangeable needles are a subset of circular needles.

they are kits consist of pairs of needles with usually nylon cables or cords.

the cables/cords are screwed into the needles, allowing the knitter to have both flexible straight needles or circular needles.

this also allows the knitter to change the diameter and length of the needles as needed.

the needles must be screwed on tightly, otherwise yarn can snag and become damaged.

circular knitting needles in different lengths, materials and sizes, including plastic, aluminum, steel and nickel-plated brassthe ability to work from either end of one needle is convenient in several types of knitting, such as slip-stitch versions of double knitting.

circular needles may be used for flat or circular knitting.

cable needles are a special case of dpns, although they are usually not straight, but dimpled in the middle.

cable needles are typically very short (a few inches), and are used to hold stitches temporarily while others are being knitted.

when in use, the cable needle is used at the same time as two regular needles.

at specific points indicated by the knitting pattern, the cable needle is moved, the stitches on it are worked by the other needles, then the cable needle is turned around to a different position to create the cable twist.

cable needles cable needles are a specific design, and are used to create the twisting motif of a knitted cable.

largest circular knitting needles[edit] the largest aluminum circular knitting needles on record are size us 150 and are nearly 7 feet tall.

record[edit] julia hopson with world-record 3.5 meter (11'6") long knitting needles the current holder of the guinness world record for knitting with the largest knitting needles is julia hopson[24] of penzance in cornwall.

julia knitted a square of ten stitches and ten rows in stockinette stitch using knitting needles that were 6.5 centimeters (2½") in diameter and 3.5 meters (11'6") long.

starting from the bottom right are two crochet hooks, two stitch holders (like big blunt safety pins), and two cable needles in pink and green.

on the left are a pair of scissors, a yarn needle, green and blue stitch markers, and two orange point protectors.

at the top left are two blue point protectors, one on a red needle.

tools for measuring needle diameter and yarn properties have been discussed above, as well as the yarn swift, ballwinder and "yarntainers".

crochet hooks and a darning needle are often useful in binding/casting off or in joining two knitted pieces edge-to-edge.

the darning needle is used in duplicate stitch (also known as swiss darning).

a second potential difficulty is that the knitted piece will slide off the tapered end of the needles when unattended; this is prevented by "point protectors" that cap the tapered ends.

in traditional shetland knitting a special belt is often used to support the end of one needle allowing the knitting greater speed.

finally, there are sundry bags and containers for holding knitting, yarns and needles.

norwegian style[edit] main article: norwegian knitting while knit stitches are worked as in the classic continental style, the purl is worked by leaving the yarn at back and moving the needle.

[25] russian style[edit] another variation on continental knitting, this style is achieved by "picking" up the yarn by moving the needle head into it.

you will wind up with your index finger very close to the back of your left-hand needle.

mega knitting[edit] mega knitting is a term recently coined and relates to the use of knitting needles greater than or equal to half an inch in diameter.

mega knitting uses the same stitches and techniques as conventional knitting, except that hooks are carved into the ends of the needles.

the hooked needles greatly enhance control of the work, catching the stitches and preventing them from slipping off.

it was the development of the knitting machine that introduced hooked needles and enabled faultless, automated knitting.

the hook catches the loop of yarn as each stitch is knitted, meaning that wrists and fingers do not have to work so hard and there is less chance of stitches slipping off the needle.

[26] micro knitting[edit] micro knitting or miniature knitting uses extremely fine threads and needles.

anthea crome created 14 tiny sweaters used in the stop motion animated film coraline and has made objects at 60 or 80 stitches per inch, making her own needles from fine surgical steel wire.

annelies de kort has knitted on an even smaller scale and has used needles of 0.4mm.

german short row[edit] in german short rows, the work is turned and the last stitch worked is slipped purlwise with yarn in front to the right needle.

finally, the working yarn is pulled over the top of the needle to the back, which rotates the stitch on the needle so that it tips backwards, forming what appears to be a double-stitch, sometimes referred to as a “german double stitch”.

the working yarn stays to the back for the next stitch if it is to be knitted, or rotated below the right needle and pulled to the front, if it is to be purled, both of which maintain the proper (“tipped back”) orientation of the german double stitch.

[46] health benefits[edit] the earliest image of circular knitting, from the 15th century ad buxtehude altarpiece studies have shown that hand knitting, along with other forms of needlework, provide several significant health benefits.

^ a b c a wale, according to knitting technology: a comprehensive handbook and practical guide, is "a predominantly vertical column of needle loops generally produced by the same needles at successive (not necessarily all) knitting cycles.

a wale starts as soon as an empty needle starts to knit" (spencer 1989:17).

there are usually many active stitches on the knitting needle at one time.

as each row is formed, each newly created loop is pulled through one or more loops from the prior row and placed on the gaining needle so that the loops from the prior row can be pulled off the other needle without unraveling.

differences in yarn (varying in fibre type, weight, uniformity and twist), needle size, and stitch type allow for a variety of knitted fabrics with different properties, including color, texture, thickness, heat retention, water resistance, and integrity.

during knitting, the active stitches are secured mechanically, either from individual hooks (in knitting machines) or from a knitting needle or frame in hand-knitting.

not every stitch in a row need be knitted; some may be 'missed' (unknitted and passed to the active needle) and knitted on a subsequent row.

when knitting, a pair of long needles is needed to be able to form the loops from one set of loop to another through the needles.

hand-knitters generally produce right-plaited stitches by knitting or purling through the back loops, i.e., passing the needle through the initial stitch in an unusual way, but wrapping the yarn as usual.

by contrast, the left-plaited stitch is generally formed by hand-knitters by wrapping the yarn in the opposite way, rather than by any change in the needle.

[14] nålebinding (danish: literally "binding with a needle" or "needle-binding") is a fabric creation technique predating both knitting and crochet.

similar to quilting, spinning, and needlepoint, hand knitting became a leisure activity for the wealthy.

adding a "slip stitch" (where a loop is passed from one needle to the other) allows for a wide range of textures, including heel and linen stitches as well as a number of more complicated patterns.

combining certain increases, which can create small eyelet holes in the resulting fabric, with assorted decreases is key to creating knitted lace, a very open fabric resembling needle or bobbin lace.

changing the order of stitches from one row to the next, usually with the help of a cable needle or stitch holder, is key to cable knitting, producing an endless variety of cables, honeycombs, ropes, and aran sweater patterning.

a piece of hand knitting begins with the process of casting on, which involves the initial creation of the stitches on the needle.

there are various methods employed to cast on, such as the "thumb method" (also known as "slingshot" or "long-tail" cast-ons), where the stitches are created by a series of loops that will, when knitted, give a very loose edge ideal for "picking up stitches" and knitting a border; the "double needle method" (also known as "knit-on" or "cable cast-on"), whereby each loop placed on the needle is then "knitted on", which produces a firmer edge ideal on its own as a border; and many more.

there are also different ways to insert the needle into the stitch.

casting (or "binding") off loops the stitches across each other so they can be removed from the needle without unravelling the item.

smaller items, such as socks and hats, are usually knit in one piece on double-pointed needles or circular needles.

hats in particular can be started "top down" on double pointed needles with the increases added until the preferred size is achieved, switching to an appropriate circular needle when enough stitches have been added.

skeins and balls are generally sold with a yarn-band, a label that describes the yarn's weight, length, dye lot, fiber content, washing instructions, suggested needle size, likely gauge/tension, etc.

thicker yarns generally require thicker knitting needles, whereas thinner yarns may be knit with thick or thin needles.

in very simple cases, knitting can be done without tools, using only the fingers to do these tasks; however, knitting is usually carried out using tools such as knitting needles, knitting machines or rigid frames.

needles[edit] main article: knitting needle knitting needles in a variety of sizes and materials.

there are three basic types of knitting needles (also called "knitting pins").

such needles are usually 10–16 inches (250–410 mm) long but, due to the compressibility of knitted fabrics, may be used to knit pieces significantly wider.

the most important property of needles is their diameter, which ranges from below 2 to 25 mm (roughly 1 inch).

thus, a simple way to change gauge/tension is to use different needles, which is the basis of uneven knitting.

although the diameter of the knitting needle is often measured in millimeters, there are several measurement systems, particularly those specific to the united states, the united kingdom and japan; a conversion table is given at knitting needle.

such knitting needles may be made out of any materials, but the most common materials are metals, wood, bamboo, and plastic.

different materials have different frictions and grip the yarn differently; slick needles such as metallic needles are useful for swift knitting, whereas rougher needles such as bamboo offer more friction and are therefore less prone to dropping stitches.

needles with lighted tips have been sold to allow knitters to knit in the dark.

double-pointed knitting needles in various materials and sizes.

the second type of knitting needles are straight, double-pointed knitting needles (also called "dpns").

double-pointed needles are tapered at both ends, which allows them to be knit from either end.

dpns are typically used for circular knitting, especially smaller tube-shaped pieces such as sleeves, collars, and socks; usually one needle is active while the others hold the remaining active stitches.

the third needle type consists of circular needles, which are long, flexible double-pointed needles.

circular needles are typically 24-60 inches long, and are usually used singly or in pairs; again, the width of the knitted piece may be significantly longer than the length of the circular needle.

interchangeable needles are a subset of circular needles.

they are kits consist of pairs of needles with usually nylon cables or cords.

the cables/cords are screwed into the needles, allowing the knitter to have both flexible straight needles or circular needles.

this also allows the knitter to change the diameter and length of the needles as needed.

the needles must be screwed on tightly, otherwise yarn can snag and become damaged.

circular knitting needles in different lengths, materials and sizes, including plastic, aluminum, steel and nickel-plated brassthe ability to work from either end of one needle is convenient in several types of knitting, such as slip-stitch versions of double knitting.

circular needles may be used for flat or circular knitting.

cable needles are a special case of dpns, although they are usually not straight, but dimpled in the middle.

cable needles are typically very short (a few inches), and are used to hold stitches temporarily while others are being knitted.

when in use, the cable needle is used at the same time as two regular needles.

at specific points indicated by the knitting pattern, the cable needle is moved, the stitches on it are worked by the other needles, then the cable needle is turned around to a different position to create the cable twist.

cable needles cable needles are a specific design, and are used to create the twisting motif of a knitted cable.

largest circular knitting needles[edit] the largest aluminum circular knitting needles on record are size us 150 and are nearly 7 feet tall.

record[edit] julia hopson with world-record 3.5 meter (11'6") long knitting needles the current holder of the guinness world record for knitting with the largest knitting needles is julia hopson[24] of penzance in cornwall.

julia knitted a square of ten stitches and ten rows in stockinette stitch using knitting needles that were 6.5 centimeters (2½") in diameter and 3.5 meters (11'6") long.

starting from the bottom right are two crochet hooks, two stitch holders (like big blunt safety pins), and two cable needles in pink and green.

on the left are a pair of scissors, a yarn needle, green and blue stitch markers, and two orange point protectors.

at the top left are two blue point protectors, one on a red needle.

tools for measuring needle diameter and yarn properties have been discussed above, as well as the yarn swift, ballwinder and "yarntainers".

crochet hooks and a darning needle are often useful in binding/casting off or in joining two knitted pieces edge-to-edge.

the darning needle is used in duplicate stitch (also known as swiss darning).

a second potential difficulty is that the knitted piece will slide off the tapered end of the needles when unattended; this is prevented by "point protectors" that cap the tapered ends.

in traditional shetland knitting a special belt is often used to support the end of one needle allowing the knitting greater speed.

finally, there are sundry bags and containers for holding knitting, yarns and needles.

norwegian style[edit] main article: norwegian knitting while knit stitches are worked as in the classic continental style, the purl is worked by leaving the yarn at back and moving the needle.

[25] russian style[edit] another variation on continental knitting, this style is achieved by "picking" up the yarn by moving the needle head into it.

you will wind up with your index finger very close to the back of your left-hand needle.

mega knitting[edit] mega knitting is a term recently coined and relates to the use of knitting needles greater than or equal to half an inch in diameter.

mega knitting uses the same stitches and techniques as conventional knitting, except that hooks are carved into the ends of the needles.

the hooked needles greatly enhance control of the work, catching the stitches and preventing them from slipping off.

it was the development of the knitting machine that introduced hooked needles and enabled faultless, automated knitting.

the hook catches the loop of yarn as each stitch is knitted, meaning that wrists and fingers do not have to work so hard and there is less chance of stitches slipping off the needle.

[26] micro knitting[edit] micro knitting or miniature knitting uses extremely fine threads and needles.

anthea crome created 14 tiny sweaters used in the stop motion animated film coraline and has made objects at 60 or 80 stitches per inch, making her own needles from fine surgical steel wire.

annelies de kort has knitted on an even smaller scale and has used needles of 0.4mm.

german short row[edit] in german short rows, the work is turned and the last stitch worked is slipped purlwise with yarn in front to the right needle.

finally, the working yarn is pulled over the top of the needle to the back, which rotates the stitch on the needle so that it tips backwards, forming what appears to be a double-stitch, sometimes referred to as a “german double stitch”.

the working yarn stays to the back for the next stitch if it is to be knitted, or rotated below the right needle and pulled to the front, if it is to be purled, both of which maintain the proper (“tipped back”) orientation of the german double stitch.

[46] health benefits[edit] the earliest image of circular knitting, from the 15th century ad buxtehude altarpiece studies have shown that hand knitting, along with other forms of needlework, provide several significant health benefits.

^ a b c a wale, according to knitting technology: a comprehensive handbook and practical guide, is "a predominantly vertical column of needle loops generally produced by the same needles at successive (not necessarily all) knitting cycles.

a wale starts as soon as an empty needle starts to knit" (spencer 1989:17).

i did make this project about 10 or so years ago and i remember that it did not really look like the picture until it was completed, while it was on the needles it looked like it wasn't lining up.

there are five basic knitting styles based on the way the yarn is held and wrapped around the working needle.

english knitting is a knitting style that involves holding the yarn in the dominant hand, alongside the working needle.

because this style holds the yarn in the non-dominant hand, there is no need to move the yarn in front or behind the needles in order to switch between knitting and purling.

instead, the yarn is either placed above or below the needle in the non-dominant hand.

this makes russian style a very tight hold that allows you to flick the yarn over the tip of the needle instead of picking it with the needle itself.

lever knitting a knitting style in which the knitter holds the working yarn in the dominant hand and loops the yarn around the working needle without removing the dominant hand from the needle completely, creating a sort of back-and-forth levering motion.

many knitters who use this style hold their working needle like a pencil, which frees up their pointer finger to hold the tension of their yarn and "flick" it around the end of the needle.

in every other knitting style, the tension is held in the hands; this gives your hands two jobs to do at the same time -- holding the yarn and working the stitches with the needles.

shetland knitting other names: pit knitting, scottish, shetland, from the hip, old way what is shetland knitting if you're picturing a woman standing in the scottish highlands with a knitting needle attached to a belt around her waist and knitting, you're probably not far off.

the shetland style of knitting goes by many names, but it's recognizable because of the way the working needle is held against the body.

because the dominant hand doesn't have to worry about holding the tension of the yarn and the working needle at the same time, this style of knitting is much faster.

knitting style is a synonym for a knitting hold -- the way you hold your needles and yarn.

combination knitting is popular because you can easily switch between knitting and purling without moving the yarn from one side of the needles to the other.
