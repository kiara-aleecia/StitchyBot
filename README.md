# WebCrawler + ChatterBotChatBot

Webcrawling was used to create a corpus and knowledge base for the chatterbot to learn from.

ChatterBot is a machine-learning based conversational dialog engine build in
Python which makes it possible to generate responses based on collections of
known conversations. The language independent design of ChatterBot allows it
to be trained to speak any language.

Run stitchybot.py in .\stitchy.chatterbot\Chatbot-master\examples

Python must be python3 version 3.7 or lower in order to run our chatbot (most straightforward way to achieve this is to run it in a virtual environment)

if there are problems running the bot, further troubleshooting instructions are available on our other Github repository at https://github.com/cmn180003/Chatbot/tree/master
