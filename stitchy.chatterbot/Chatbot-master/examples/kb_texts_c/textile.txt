crochet (english: /kroʊˈʃeɪ/;[1] french: [kʁɔʃɛ][2]) is a process of creating textiles by using a crochet hook to interlock loops of yarn, thread, or strands of other materials.

the word crochet subsequently came to describe both the specific type of textile, and the hooked needle used to produce it.

[5] origins[edit] 19th century crochet from orvieto, italy knitted textiles survive from as early as the 11th century ce, but the first substantive evidence of crocheted fabric emerges in europe during the 19th century.

[38] architecture[edit] in style in the technical arts, gottfried semper looks at the textile with great promise and historical precedent.

in the same section, semper confesses his ignorance of the subject of crochet but believes strongly that it is a technique of great value as a textile technique and possibly something more.
