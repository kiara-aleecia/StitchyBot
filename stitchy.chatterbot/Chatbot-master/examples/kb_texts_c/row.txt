examples of such tools include cardboard cutouts, which can be used to make tassels, fringe, and many other items; a pom-pom circle, used to make pom-poms; a tape measure and a gauge measure, both used for measuring crocheted work and counting stitches; a row counter; and occasionally plastic rings, which are used for special projects.

the thickness or weight of the yarn is a significant factor in determining how many stitches and rows are required to cover a given area for a given stitch pattern.

the chain is either turned and worked in rows, or joined to the beginning of the row with a slip stitch and worked in rounds.

tunisian crochet, however, draws all of the loops for an entire row onto a long hook before working them off one at a time.

like knitting, crochet can be worked either flat (back and forth in rows) or in the round (in spirals, such as when making tubular pieces).

in most crochet, the artisan usually has only one live stitch on the hook (with the exception being tunisian crochet), while a knitter keeps an entire row of stitches active simultaneously.

in knitting, each stitch is supported by the corresponding stitch in the row above and it supports the corresponding stitch in the row below, whereas crochet stitches are only supported by and support the stitches on either side of it.
