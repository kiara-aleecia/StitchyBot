the word crochet subsequently came to describe both the specific type of textile, and the hooked needle used to produce it.

the instructions prescribe the use of a tambour needle (as illustrated below) and introduce a number of decorative techniques.

[10] in 1844, one of the numerous books discussing crochet that began to appear in the 1840s states: crochet needles, sometimes called shepherds' hooks, are made of steel, ivory, or box-wood.

these instruments are to be procured of various sizes...[11] two years later, the same author writes: crochet, — a species of knitting originally practised by the peasants in scotland, with a small hooked needle called a shepherd's hook, — has, within the last seven years, aided by taste and fashion, obtained the preference over all other ornamental works of a similar nature.

the tip of the needle shown there is indistinguishable from that of a present-day inline crochet hook and the chain stitch separated from a cloth support is a fundamental element of the latter technique.

the design with a cylindrical shaft that is commonplace today was largely reserved for tambour-style steel needles.

[citation needed] the early instruction books make frequent reference to the alternative use of 'ivory, bone, or wooden hooks' and 'steel needles in a handle', as appropriate to the stitch being made.

the design of this example is closely based on flemish needle lace of the 17th century.

see : list of united states standard crochet hook and knitting needle sizes yarn[edit] main article: yarn a hank of wool yarn (center) is uncoiled into its basic loop.

skeins and balls are generally sold with a yarn band, a label that describes the yarn's weight, length, dye lot, fiber content, washing instructions, suggested needle size, likely gauge, etc.

using the latter is better for needlework, since the yarn is much less likely to tangle.

[citation needed] differences from and similarities to knitting[edit] one of the more obvious differences is that crochet uses one hook while much knitting uses two needles.

[citation needed] round or cylindrical patterns are simple to produce with a regular crochet hook, but cylindrical knitting requires either a set of circular needles or three to five special double-ended needles.

although this is true when comparing a single crochet swatch with a stockinette swatch, both made with the same size yarn and needle/hook, it is not necessarily true for crochet in general.

any yarn can be either knitted or crocheted, provided needles or hooks of the correct size are used, but the cord's properties should be taken into account.

knitting uses two or more straight needles that carry multiple stitches.

unlike crochet, knitting requires specialized needles to create circular rounds.

the word crochet subsequently came to describe both the specific type of textile, and the hooked needle used to produce it.

the instructions prescribe the use of a tambour needle (as illustrated below) and introduce a number of decorative techniques.

[10] in 1844, one of the numerous books discussing crochet that began to appear in the 1840s states: crochet needles, sometimes called shepherds' hooks, are made of steel, ivory, or box-wood.

these instruments are to be procured of various sizes...[11] two years later, the same author writes: crochet, — a species of knitting originally practised by the peasants in scotland, with a small hooked needle called a shepherd's hook, — has, within the last seven years, aided by taste and fashion, obtained the preference over all other ornamental works of a similar nature.

the tip of the needle shown there is indistinguishable from that of a present-day inline crochet hook and the chain stitch separated from a cloth support is a fundamental element of the latter technique.

the design with a cylindrical shaft that is commonplace today was largely reserved for tambour-style steel needles.

[citation needed] the early instruction books make frequent reference to the alternative use of 'ivory, bone, or wooden hooks' and 'steel needles in a handle', as appropriate to the stitch being made.

the design of this example is closely based on flemish needle lace of the 17th century.

see : list of united states standard crochet hook and knitting needle sizes yarn[edit] main article: yarn a hank of wool yarn (center) is uncoiled into its basic loop.

skeins and balls are generally sold with a yarn band, a label that describes the yarn's weight, length, dye lot, fiber content, washing instructions, suggested needle size, likely gauge, etc.

using the latter is better for needlework, since the yarn is much less likely to tangle.

[citation needed] differences from and similarities to knitting[edit] one of the more obvious differences is that crochet uses one hook while much knitting uses two needles.

[citation needed] round or cylindrical patterns are simple to produce with a regular crochet hook, but cylindrical knitting requires either a set of circular needles or three to five special double-ended needles.

although this is true when comparing a single crochet swatch with a stockinette swatch, both made with the same size yarn and needle/hook, it is not necessarily true for crochet in general.

any yarn can be either knitted or crocheted, provided needles or hooks of the correct size are used, but the cord's properties should be taken into account.

knitting uses two or more straight needles that carry multiple stitches.

unlike crochet, knitting requires specialized needles to create circular rounds.
