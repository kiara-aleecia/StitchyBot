crochet (english: /kroʊˈʃeɪ/;[1] french: [kʁɔʃɛ][2]) is a process of creating textiles by using a crochet hook to interlock loops of yarn, thread, or strands of other materials.

[3] the name is derived from the french term crochet, meaning 'hook'.

hooks can be made from a variety of materials, such as metal, wood, bamboo, or plastic.

demonstration of crochet technique etymology[edit] the word crochet is derived from the french crochet, a diminutive of croche, in turn from the germanic croc, both meaning "hook".

the word crochet subsequently came to describe both the specific type of textile, and the hooked needle used to produce it.

the earliest dated reference in english to garments made of cloth produced by looping yarn with a hook—shepherd's knitting—is in the memoirs of a highland lady by elizabeth grant (1797–1830).

[9] nonetheless, the 1833 volume of penélopé describes and illustrates a shepherd's hook, and recommends its use for crochet with coarser yarn.

[10] in 1844, one of the numerous books discussing crochet that began to appear in the 1840s states: crochet needles, sometimes called shepherds' hooks, are made of steel, ivory, or box-wood.

they have a hook at one end similar in shape to a fish-hook, by which the wool or silk is caught and drawn through the work.

these instruments are to be procured of various sizes...[11] two years later, the same author writes: crochet, — a species of knitting originally practised by the peasants in scotland, with a small hooked needle called a shepherd's hook, — has, within the last seven years, aided by taste and fashion, obtained the preference over all other ornamental works of a similar nature.

the tip of the needle shown there is indistinguishable from that of a present-day inline crochet hook and the chain stitch separated from a cloth support is a fundamental element of the latter technique.

[16] shepherd's hook, 19th-century tapered hook, modern inline hook the strong taper of the shepherd's hook eases the production of slip-stitch crochet but is less amenable to stitches that require multiple loops on the hook at the same time.

early yarn hooks were also continuously tapered but gradually enough to accommodate multiple loops.

both types gradually merged into the modern form that appeared toward the end of the 19th century, including both tapered and cylindrical segments, and the continuously tapered bone hook remained in industrial production until world war ii.

[citation needed] the early instruction books make frequent reference to the alternative use of 'ivory, bone, or wooden hooks' and 'steel needles in a handle', as appropriate to the stitch being made.

shepherd's hooks are still being made for local slip-stitch crochet traditions.

a longer continuously tapering design intermediate between it and the 19th-century tapered hook was also in earlier production, commonly being made from the handles of forks and spoons.

[21] filet crochet, tunisian crochet, tapestry crochet, broomstick lace, hairpin lace, cro-hooking, and irish crochet are all variants of the basic crochet method.

materials[edit] basic materials required for crochet are a hook and some type of material that will be crocheted, most commonly yarn or thread.

[citation needed] crochet hook[edit] aluminium crochet hooks main article: crochet hook the crochet hook comes in many sizes and materials, such as bone, bamboo, aluminium, plastic, and steel.

[23] because sizing is categorized by the diameter of the hook's shaft, a crafter aims to create stitches of a certain size in order to reach a particular gauge specified in a given pattern.

if gauge is not reached with one hook, another is used until the stitches made are the needed size.

crafters may have a preference for one type of hook material over another due to aesthetic appeal, yarn glide, or hand disorders such as arthritis, where bamboo or wood hooks are favored over metal for the perceived warmth and flexibility during use.

hook grips and ergonomic hook handles are also available to assist crafters.

steel crochet hooks range in size from 0.4 to 3.5 millimeters, or from 00 to 16 in american sizing.

these hooks are used for fine crochet work such as doilies and lace.

aluminium, bamboo, and plastic crochet hooks are available from 2.5 to 19 millimeters in size, or from b to s in american sizing.

[citation needed] artisan-made hooks are often made of hand-turned woods, sometimes decorated with semi-precious stones or beads.

crochet hooks used for tunisian crochet are elongated and have a stopper at the end of the handle, while double-ended crochet hooks have a hook on both ends of the handle.

there is also a double hooked apparatus called a cro-hook that has become popular.

while this is not in itself a hook, it is a device used in conjunction with a crochet hook to produce stitches.

see : list of united states standard crochet hook and knitting needle sizes yarn[edit] main article: yarn a hank of wool yarn (center) is uncoiled into its basic loop.

thicker yarns generally require large-diameter crochet hooks, whereas thinner yarns may be crocheted with thick or thin hooks.

crochet tablecloth, kolkata, west bengal, india crocheted fabric is begun by placing a slip-knot loop on the hook (though other methods, such as a magic ring or simple folding over of the yarn may be used), pulling another loop through the first loop, and repeating this process to create a chain of a suitable length.

at any one time at the end of a stitch, there is only one loop left on the hook.

tunisian crochet, however, draws all of the loops for an entire row onto a long hook before working them off one at a time.

[citation needed] the more advanced stitches are often combinations of these basic stitches, or are made by inserting the hook into the work in unusual locations.

in the united states, crochet terminology and sizing guidelines, as well as standards for yarn and hook labeling, are primarily regulated by the craft yarn council.

an individual crocheter begins work by producing a test swatch and compensating for any discrepancy by changing to a smaller or larger hook.

[citation needed] differences from and similarities to knitting[edit] one of the more obvious differences is that crochet uses one hook while much knitting uses two needles.

in most crochet, the artisan usually has only one live stitch on the hook (with the exception being tunisian crochet), while a knitter keeps an entire row of stitches active simultaneously.

[citation needed] round or cylindrical patterns are simple to produce with a regular crochet hook, but cylindrical knitting requires either a set of circular needles or three to five special double-ended needles.

[27] while most crochet is made with a hook, there is also a method of crocheting with a knitting loom.

although this is true when comparing a single crochet swatch with a stockinette swatch, both made with the same size yarn and needle/hook, it is not necessarily true for crochet in general.

most crochet uses far less than 1/3 more yarn than knitting for comparable pieces, and a crocheter can get similar feel and drape to knitting by using a larger hook or thinner yarn.

any yarn can be either knitted or crocheted, provided needles or hooks of the correct size are used, but the cord's properties should be taken into account.

[31] differences between crochet and knitting most crochet uses one hook and works upon one stitch at a time.

crochet ( english : / kroʊˈʃeɪ /;[ 1 ] french : [ kʁɔʃɛ ][ 2 ]) is a process of creating textiles by using a crochet hook to interlock loops of yarn , thread , or strands of other materials .

[ 3 ] the name is derived from the french term crochet , meaning ' hook '.

hooks can be made from a variety of materials , such as metal , wood , bamboo , or plastic .

demonstration of crochet technique etymology [ edit ] the word crochet is derived from the french crochet , a diminutive of croche , in turn from the germanic croc , both meaning " hook ".

the word crochet subsequently came to describe both the specific type of textile , and the hooked needle used to produce it .

the earliest dated reference in english to garments made of cloth produced by looping yarn with a hook — shepherd ' s knitting — is in the memoirs of a highland lady by elizabeth grant ( 1797 – 1830 ).

[ 9 ] nonetheless , the 1833 volume of penélopé describes and illustrates a shepherd ' s hook , and recommends its use for crochet with coarser yarn .

[ 10 ] in 1844 , one of the numerous books discussing crochet that began to appear in the 1840s states : crochet needles , sometimes called shepherds ' hooks , are made of steel , ivory , or box - wood .

they have a hook at one end similar in shape to a fish - hook , by which the wool or silk is caught and drawn through the work .

these instruments are to be procured of various sizes ...[ 11 ] two years later , the same author writes : crochet , — a species of knitting originally practised by the peasants in scotland , with a small hooked needle called a shepherd ' s hook , — has , within the last seven years , aided by taste and fashion , obtained the preference over all other ornamental works of a similar nature .

the tip of the needle shown there is indistinguishable from that of a present - day inline crochet hook and the chain stitch separated from a cloth support is a fundamental element of the latter technique .

[ 16 ] shepherd ' s hook , 19th - century tapered hook , modern inline hook the strong taper of the shepherd ' s hook eases the production of slip - stitch crochet but is less amenable to stitches that require multiple loops on the hook at the same time .

early yarn hooks were also continuously tapered but gradually enough to accommodate multiple loops .

both types gradually merged into the modern form that appeared toward the end of the 19th century , including both tapered and cylindrical segments , and the continuously tapered bone hook remained in industrial production until world war ii .

[ citation needed ] the early instruction books make frequent reference to the alternative use of ' ivory , bone , or wooden hooks ' and ' steel needles in a handle ', as appropriate to the stitch being made .

shepherd ' s hooks are still being made for local slip - stitch crochet traditions .

a longer continuously tapering design intermediate between it and the 19th - century tapered hook was also in earlier production , commonly being made from the handles of forks and spoons .

[ 21 ] filet crochet , tunisian crochet , tapestry crochet , broomstick lace , hairpin lace , cro - hooking , and irish crochet are all variants of the basic crochet method .

materials [ edit ] basic materials required for crochet are a hook and some type of material that will be crocheted , most commonly yarn or thread .

[ citation needed ] crochet hook [ edit ] aluminium crochet hooks main article : crochet hook the crochet hook comes in many sizes and materials , such as bone , bamboo , aluminium , plastic , and steel .

[ 23 ] because sizing is categorized by the diameter of the hook ' s shaft , a crafter aims to create stitches of a certain size in order to reach a particular gauge specified in a given pattern .

if gauge is not reached with one hook , another is used until the stitches made are the needed size .

crafters may have a preference for one type of hook material over another due to aesthetic appeal , yarn glide , or hand disorders such as arthritis , where bamboo or wood hooks are favored over metal for the perceived warmth and flexibility during use .

hook grips and ergonomic hook handles are also available to assist crafters .

steel crochet hooks range in size from 0 .

these hooks are used for fine crochet work such as doilies and lace .

aluminium , bamboo , and plastic crochet hooks are available from 2 .

[ citation needed ] artisan - made hooks are often made of hand - turned woods , sometimes decorated with semi - precious stones or beads .

crochet hooks used for tunisian crochet are elongated and have a stopper at the end of the handle , while double - ended crochet hooks have a hook on both ends of the handle .

there is also a double hooked apparatus called a cro - hook that has become popular .

while this is not in itself a hook , it is a device used in conjunction with a crochet hook to produce stitches .

see : list of united states standard crochet hook and knitting needle sizes yarn [ edit ] main article : yarn a hank of wool yarn ( center ) is uncoiled into its basic loop .

thicker yarns generally require large - diameter crochet hooks , whereas thinner yarns may be crocheted with thick or thin hooks .

crochet tablecloth , kolkata , west bengal , india crocheted fabric is begun by placing a slip - knot loop on the hook ( though other methods , such as a magic ring or simple folding over of the yarn may be used ), pulling another loop through the first loop , and repeating this process to create a chain of a suitable length .

at any one time at the end of a stitch , there is only one loop left on the hook .

tunisian crochet , however , draws all of the loops for an entire row onto a long hook before working them off one at a time .

[ citation needed ] the more advanced stitches are often combinations of these basic stitches , or are made by inserting the hook into the work in unusual locations .

in the united states , crochet terminology and sizing guidelines , as well as standards for yarn and hook labeling , are primarily regulated by the craft yarn council .

an individual crocheter begins work by producing a test swatch and compensating for any discrepancy by changing to a smaller or larger hook .

[ citation needed ] differences from and similarities to knitting [ edit ] one of the more obvious differences is that crochet uses one hook while much knitting uses two needles .

in most crochet , the artisan usually has only one live stitch on the hook ( with the exception being tunisian crochet ), while a knitter keeps an entire row of stitches active simultaneously .

[ citation needed ] round or cylindrical patterns are simple to produce with a regular crochet hook , but cylindrical knitting requires either a set of circular needles or three to five special double - ended needles .

[ 27 ] while most crochet is made with a hook , there is also a method of crocheting with a knitting loom .

although this is true when comparing a single crochet swatch with a stockinette swatch , both made with the same size yarn and needle / hook , it is not necessarily true for crochet in general .

most crochet uses far less than 1 / 3 more yarn than knitting for comparable pieces , and a crocheter can get similar feel and drape to knitting by using a larger hook or thinner yarn .

any yarn can be either knitted or crocheted , provided needles or hooks of the correct size are used , but the cord ' s properties should be taken into account .

[ 31 ] differences between crochet and knitting most crochet uses one hook and works upon one stitch at a time .

thicker yarns generally require large-diameter crochet hooks, whereas thinner yarns may be crocheted with thick or thin hooks.

crochet tablecloth, kolkata, west bengal, india crocheted fabric is begun by placing a slip-knot loop on the hook (though other methods, such as a magic ring or simple folding over of the yarn may be used), pulling another loop through the first loop, and repeating this process to create a chain of a suitable length.

at any one time at the end of a stitch, there is only one loop left on the hook.

tunisian crochet, however, draws all of the loops for an entire row onto a long hook before working them off one at a time.

[citation needed] the more advanced stitches are often combinations of these basic stitches, or are made by inserting the hook into the work in unusual locations.

in the united states, crochet terminology and sizing guidelines, as well as standards for yarn and hook labeling, are primarily regulated by the craft yarn council.

an individual crocheter begins work by producing a test swatch and compensating for any discrepancy by changing to a smaller or larger hook.

[citation needed] differences from and similarities to knitting[edit] one of the more obvious differences is that crochet uses one hook while much knitting uses two needles.

in most crochet, the artisan usually has only one live stitch on the hook (with the exception being tunisian crochet), while a knitter keeps an entire row of stitches active simultaneously.

[citation needed] round or cylindrical patterns are simple to produce with a regular crochet hook, but cylindrical knitting requires either a set of circular needles or three to five special double-ended needles.

[27] while most crochet is made with a hook, there is also a method of crocheting with a knitting loom.

although this is true when comparing a single crochet swatch with a stockinette swatch, both made with the same size yarn and needle/hook, it is not necessarily true for crochet in general.

most crochet uses far less than 1/3 more yarn than knitting for comparable pieces, and a crocheter can get similar feel and drape to knitting by using a larger hook or thinner yarn.

any yarn can be either knitted or crocheted, provided needles or hooks of the correct size are used, but the cord's properties should be taken into account.

crochet ( english : / kroʊˈʃeɪ /;[ 1 ] french : [ kʁɔʃɛ ][ 2 ]) is a process of creating textiles by using a crochet hook to interlock loops of yarn , thread , or strands of other materials .

[ 3 ] the name is derived from the french term crochet , meaning ' hook '.

hooks can be made from a variety of materials , such as metal , wood , bamboo , or plastic .

demonstration of crochet technique etymology [ edit ] the word crochet is derived from the french crochet , a diminutive of croche , in turn from the germanic croc , both meaning " hook ".

the word crochet subsequently came to describe both the specific type of textile , and the hooked needle used to produce it .

the earliest dated reference in english to garments made of cloth produced by looping yarn with a hook — shepherd ' s knitting — is in the memoirs of a highland lady by elizabeth grant ( 1797 – 1830 ).

[ 9 ] nonetheless , the 1833 volume of penélopé describes and illustrates a shepherd ' s hook , and recommends its use for crochet with coarser yarn .

[ 10 ] in 1844 , one of the numerous books discussing crochet that began to appear in the 1840s states : crochet needles , sometimes called shepherds ' hooks , are made of steel , ivory , or box - wood .

they have a hook at one end similar in shape to a fish - hook , by which the wool or silk is caught and drawn through the work .

these instruments are to be procured of various sizes ...[ 11 ] two years later , the same author writes : crochet , — a species of knitting originally practised by the peasants in scotland , with a small hooked needle called a shepherd ' s hook , — has , within the last seven years , aided by taste and fashion , obtained the preference over all other ornamental works of a similar nature .

the tip of the needle shown there is indistinguishable from that of a present - day inline crochet hook and the chain stitch separated from a cloth support is a fundamental element of the latter technique .

[ 16 ] shepherd ' s hook , 19th - century tapered hook , modern inline hook the strong taper of the shepherd ' s hook eases the production of slip - stitch crochet but is less amenable to stitches that require multiple loops on the hook at the same time .

early yarn hooks were also continuously tapered but gradually enough to accommodate multiple loops .

both types gradually merged into the modern form that appeared toward the end of the 19th century , including both tapered and cylindrical segments , and the continuously tapered bone hook remained in industrial production until world war ii .

[ citation needed ] the early instruction books make frequent reference to the alternative use of ' ivory , bone , or wooden hooks ' and ' steel needles in a handle ', as appropriate to the stitch being made .

shepherd ' s hooks are still being made for local slip - stitch crochet traditions .

a longer continuously tapering design intermediate between it and the 19th - century tapered hook was also in earlier production , commonly being made from the handles of forks and spoons .

[ 21 ] filet crochet , tunisian crochet , tapestry crochet , broomstick lace , hairpin lace , cro - hooking , and irish crochet are all variants of the basic crochet method .

materials [ edit ] basic materials required for crochet are a hook and some type of material that will be crocheted , most commonly yarn or thread .

[ citation needed ] crochet hook [ edit ] aluminium crochet hooks main article : crochet hook the crochet hook comes in many sizes and materials , such as bone , bamboo , aluminium , plastic , and steel .

[ 23 ] because sizing is categorized by the diameter of the hook ' s shaft , a crafter aims to create stitches of a certain size in order to reach a particular gauge specified in a given pattern .

if gauge is not reached with one hook , another is used until the stitches made are the needed size .

crafters may have a preference for one type of hook material over another due to aesthetic appeal , yarn glide , or hand disorders such as arthritis , where bamboo or wood hooks are favored over metal for the perceived warmth and flexibility during use .

hook grips and ergonomic hook handles are also available to assist crafters .

steel crochet hooks range in size from 0 .

these hooks are used for fine crochet work such as doilies and lace .

aluminium , bamboo , and plastic crochet hooks are available from 2 .

[ citation needed ] artisan - made hooks are often made of hand - turned woods , sometimes decorated with semi - precious stones or beads .

crochet hooks used for tunisian crochet are elongated and have a stopper at the end of the handle , while double - ended crochet hooks have a hook on both ends of the handle .

there is also a double hooked apparatus called a cro - hook that has become popular .

while this is not in itself a hook , it is a device used in conjunction with a crochet hook to produce stitches .
