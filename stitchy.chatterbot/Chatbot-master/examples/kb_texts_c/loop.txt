crochet (english: /kroʊˈʃeɪ/;[1] french: [kʁɔʃɛ][2]) is a process of creating textiles by using a crochet hook to interlock loops of yarn, thread, or strands of other materials.

[6] earlier work identified as crochet was commonly made by nålebinding, a different looped yarn technique.

the earliest dated reference in english to garments made of cloth produced by looping yarn with a hook—shepherd's knitting—is in the memoirs of a highland lady by elizabeth grant (1797–1830).

[16] shepherd's hook, 19th-century tapered hook, modern inline hook the strong taper of the shepherd's hook eases the production of slip-stitch crochet but is less amenable to stitches that require multiple loops on the hook at the same time.

early yarn hooks were also continuously tapered but gradually enough to accommodate multiple loops.

sometimes, the yarns being plied are fed at different rates, so that one yarn loops around the other, as in bouclé.

crochet tablecloth, kolkata, west bengal, india crocheted fabric is begun by placing a slip-knot loop on the hook (though other methods, such as a magic ring or simple folding over of the yarn may be used), pulling another loop through the first loop, and repeating this process to create a chain of a suitable length.

rounds can also be created by working many stitches into a single loop.

stitches are made by pulling one or more loops through each loop of the chain.

at any one time at the end of a stitch, there is only one loop left on the hook.

tunisian crochet, however, draws all of the loops for an entire row onto a long hook before working them off one at a time.

if a stitch in a finished crocheted item breaks, the stitches above and below remain intact, and because of the complex looping of each stitch, the stitches on either side are unlikely to come loose unless heavily stressed.

[clarification needed] in section 53, he writes of the "loop stitch, or noeud coulant: a knot that, if untied, causes the whole system to unravel."
