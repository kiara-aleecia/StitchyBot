the second (illustrated here) starts in a semi-open form (demi jour), where chain-stitch arches alternate with equally long segments of slip-stitch crochet, and closes with a star made with "double-crochet stitches" (dubbelde hekelsteek: double-crochet in british terminology; single-crochet in us).

the tip of the needle shown there is indistinguishable from that of a present-day inline crochet hook and the chain stitch separated from a cloth support is a fundamental element of the latter technique.

crochet tablecloth, kolkata, west bengal, india crocheted fabric is begun by placing a slip-knot loop on the hook (though other methods, such as a magic ring or simple folding over of the yarn may be used), pulling another loop through the first loop, and repeating this process to create a chain of a suitable length.

the chain is either turned and worked in rows, or joined to the beginning of the row with a slip stitch and worked in rounds.

stitches are made by pulling one or more loops through each loop of the chain.
