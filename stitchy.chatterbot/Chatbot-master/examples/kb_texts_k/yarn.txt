a yarn's usefulness for a knitting project is judged by several factors, such as its loft (its ability to trap air), its resilience (elasticity under tension), its washability and colorfastness, its hand (its feel, particularly softness vs. scratchiness), its durability against abrasion, its resistance to pilling, its hairiness (fuzziness), its tendency to twist or untwist, its overall weight and drape, its blocking and felting qualities, its comfort (breathability, moisture absorption, wicking properties) and of course its look, which includes its color, sheen, smoothness and ornamental features.

thread used in weaving is usually much finer than the yarn used in knitting, which can give the knitted fabric more bulk and less drape than a woven fabric.

if they are not secured, the loops of a knitted course will come undone when their yarn is pulled; this is known as ripping out, unravelling knitting, or humorously, frogging (because you 'rip it', this sounds like a frog croaking: 'rib-bit').

hand-knitters generally produce right-plaited stitches by knitting or purling through the back loops, i.e., passing the needle through the initial stitch in an unusual way, but wrapping the yarn as usual.

if a knitter buys insufficient yarn of a single dye lot to complete a project, additional skeins of the same dye lot can sometimes be obtained from other yarn stores or online.

the thickness or weight of the yarn is a significant factor in determining the gauge/tension, i.e., how many stitches and rows are required to cover a given area for a given stitch pattern.

patterns and motifs are coarser with thicker yarns; thicker yarns produce bold visual effects, whereas thinner yarns are best for refined patterns.

yarns are grouped by thickness into six categories: superfine, fine, light, medium, bulky and superbulky;[19] quantitatively, thickness is measured by the number of wraps per inch (wpi).

the latter is better for knitting, since the yarn is much less likely to tangle.

before knitting, the knitter will typically transform a hank/skein into a ball where the yarn emerges from the center of the ball; this making the knitting easier by preventing the yarn from becoming easily tangled.

a yarn's usefulness for a knitting project is judged by several factors, such as its loft (its ability to trap air), its resilience (elasticity under tension), its washability and colorfastness, its hand (its feel, particularly softness vs. scratchiness), its durability against abrasion, its resistance to pilling, its hairiness (fuzziness), its tendency to twist or untwist, its overall weight and drape, its blocking and felting qualities, its comfort (breathability, moisture absorption, wicking properties) and of course its look, which includes its color, sheen, smoothness and ornamental features.

different factors may be more significant than others for different knitting projects, so there is no one "best" yarn.

more resilient yarns are more forgiving of irregularities in tension; highly twisted yarns are sometimes difficult to knit, whereas untwisting yarns can lead to split stitches, in which not all the yarn is knitted into a stitch.

a key factor in knitting is stitch definition, corresponding to how well complicated stitch patterns can be seen when made from a given yarn.

smooth, highly spun yarns are best for showing off stitch patterns; at the other extreme, very fuzzy yarns or eyelash yarns have poor stitch definition, and any complicated stitch pattern would be invisible.

the two possible twists of yarn although knitting may be done with ribbons, metal wire or more exotic filaments, most yarns are made by spinning fibers.

the two possible twists of yarn although knitting may be done with ribbons, metal wire or more exotic filaments, most yarns are made by spinning fibers.

in spinning, the fibers are twisted so that the yarn resists breaking under tension; the twisting may be done in either direction, resulting in a z-twist or s-twist yarn.

if the fibers are first aligned by combing them, the yarn is smoother and called a worsted; by contrast, if the fibers are carded but not combed, the yarn is fuzzier and called woolen-spun.

the fibers making up a yarn may be continuous filament fibers such as silk and many synthetics, or they may be staples (fibers of an average length, typically a few inches); naturally filament fibers are sometimes cut up into staples before spinning.

the strength of the spun yarn against breaking is determined by the amount of twist, the length of the fibers and the thickness of the yarn.

in general, yarns become stronger with more twist (also called worst), longer fibers and thicker yarns (more fibers); for example, thinner yarns require more twist than do thicker yarns to resist breaking under tension.

in plying, two or more yarns are spun together, almost always in the opposite sense from which they were spun individually; for example, two z-twist yarns are usually plied with an s-twist.

[22] tools[edit] the process of knitting has three basic tasks: the active (unsecured) stitches must be held so they don't drop these stitches must be released sometime after they are secured new bights of yarn must be passed through the fabric, usually through active stitches, thus securing them.

a yarn's usefulness for a knitting project is judged by several factors, such as its loft (its ability to trap air), its resilience (elasticity under tension), its washability and colorfastness, its hand (its feel, particularly softness vs. scratchiness), its durability against abrasion, its resistance to pilling, its hairiness (fuzziness), its tendency to twist or untwist, its overall weight and drape, its blocking and felting qualities, its comfort (breathability, moisture absorption, wicking properties) and of course its look, which includes its color, sheen, smoothness and ornamental features.

more resilient yarns are more forgiving of irregularities in tension ; highly twisted yarns are sometimes difficult to knit , whereas untwisting yarns can lead to split stitches , in which not all the yarn is knitted into a stitch .

the two possible twists of yarn although knitting may be done with ribbons , metal wire or more exotic filaments , most yarns are made by spinning fibers .

the two possible twists of yarn although knitting may be done with ribbons , metal wire or more exotic filaments , most yarns are made by spinning fibers .

in spinning , the fibers are twisted so that the yarn resists breaking under tension ; the twisting may be done in either direction , resulting in a z - twist or s - twist yarn .

if the fibers are first aligned by combing them , the yarn is smoother and called a worsted ; by contrast , if the fibers are carded but not combed , the yarn is fuzzier and called woolen - spun .

the fibers making up a yarn may be continuous filament fibers such as silk and many synthetics , or they may be staples ( fibers of an average length , typically a few inches ); naturally filament fibers are sometimes cut up into staples before spinning .

the strength of the spun yarn against breaking is determined by the amount of twist , the length of the fibers and the thickness of the yarn .

in general , yarns become stronger with more twist ( also called worst ), longer fibers and thicker yarns ( more fibers ); for example , thinner yarns require more twist than do thicker yarns to resist breaking under tension .
