depending on the yarn and knitting pattern, knitted garments can stretch as much as 500%.

basic pattern of warp knitting.

[6] a modern knitting machine in the process of weft knitting weft-knit fabrics may also be knit with multiple yarns, usually to produce interesting color patterns.

patterns and pictures can be created in knitted fabrics by using knit and purl stitches as "pixels"; however, such pixels are usually rectangular, rather than square, depending on the gauge/tension of the knitting.

short and tall stitches may also alternate within a row, forming a fish-like oval pattern.

alternating rows of all knit stitches and all purl stitches creates a stockinette pattern/stocking stitch.

checkerboard patterns (basketweave) are also possible, the smallest of which is known as seed/moss stitch: the stitches alternate between knit and purl in every wale and along every row.

mosaic knitting is a form of slip-stitch knitting that knits alternate colored rows and uses slip stitches to form patterns; mosaic-knit fabrics tend to be stiffer than patterned fabrics produced by other methods such as fair-isle knitting.

new wales can be begun from any of the edges of a knitted fabric; this is known as picking up stitches and is the basis for entrelac, in which the wales run perpendicular to one another in a checkerboard pattern.

however, this need not be so, since the order in which stitches are knitted may be permuted so that wales cross over one another, forming a cable pattern.

cable patterns tend to draw the fabric together, making it denser and less elastic;[10] aran sweaters are a common form of knitted cabling.

[11] arbitrarily complex braid patterns can be done in cable knitting, with the proviso that the wales must move ever upwards; it is generally impossible for a wale to move up and then down the fabric.

in lace knitting, the pattern is formed by making small, stable holes in the fabric, generally with yarn overs.

this is used to great effect in lace knitting, which consists of making patterns and pictures using such holes, rather than with the stitches themselves.

additional patterns can be made on the surface of the knitted fabric using embroidery; if the embroidery resembles knitting, it is often called swiss darning.

separately knitted tubes can be applied to a knitted fabric to form complex celtic knots and other patterns that would be difficult to knit.

because there is no single straight line of yarn anywhere in the pattern, a knitted piece of fabric can stretch in all directions.

many modern stretchy garments, even as they rely on elastic synthetic materials for some stretch, also achieve at least some of their stretch through knitted patterns.

close-up of front of stockinette stitch close-up of back of stockinette stitch, also same appearance as reverse stockinette stitch the basic knitted fabric (as in the diagram, and usually called a stocking or stockinette pattern) has a definite "right side" and "wrong side".

(despite being the "wrong side", reverse stockinette is frequently used as a pattern in its own right.)

stitches can be worked from either side, and various patterns are created by mixing regular knit stitches with the "wrong side" stitches, known as purl stitches, either in columns (ribbing), rows (garter, welting), or more complex patterns.

adding a "slip stitch" (where a loop is passed from one needle to the other) allows for a wide range of textures, including heel and linen stitches as well as a number of more complicated patterns.

changing the order of stitches from one row to the next, usually with the help of a cable needle or stitch holder, is key to cable knitting, producing an endless variety of cables, honeycombs, ropes, and aran sweater patterning.

fair isle knitting uses two or more colored yarns to create patterns and forms a thicker and less flexible fabric.

more complicated techniques permit large fields of color (intarsia, for example), busy small-scale patterns of color (such as fair isle), or both (double knitting and slip-stitch color, for example).

the thickness or weight of the yarn is a significant factor in determining the gauge/tension, i.e., how many stitches and rows are required to cover a given area for a given stitch pattern.

patterns and motifs are coarser with thicker yarns; thicker yarns produce bold visual effects, whereas thinner yarns are best for refined patterns.

a key factor in knitting is stitch definition, corresponding to how well complicated stitch patterns can be seen when made from a given yarn.

smooth, highly spun yarns are best for showing off stitch patterns; at the other extreme, very fuzzy yarns or eyelash yarns have poor stitch definition, and any complicated stitch pattern would be invisible.

variegated yarns can produce interesting visual effects, such as diagonal stripes; conversely, a variegated yarn may obscure a detailed knitting design, such as a cable or lace pattern.

at specific points indicated by the knitting pattern, the cable needle is moved, the stitches on it are worked by the other needles, then the cable needle is turned around to a different position to create the cable twist.

for large or complex knitting patterns, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of which stitch should be knit in a particular way; therefore, several tools have been developed to identify the number of a particular row or stitch, including circular stitch markers, hanging markers, extra yarn and row counters.

patterns are created on the outside (public-facing) side of the piece.

patterns are created on the outside (public-facing) side of the piece.

patterns are typically created by stranding the yarn on the outside of the piece.

for individual hobbyists, websites such as etsy, big cartel and ravelry have made it easy to sell knitting patterns on a small scale, in a way similar to ebay.

over the multi-day period, multiple local yarn and knit shops participate in the yarn crawl and offer up store discounts, give away free exclusive patterns, provide classes, trunk shows and conduct raffles for prizes.

some local crawls also provide a knit-along (kal) or crochet-along (cal) where attendees follow a specific pattern prior to the crawl and then proudly wear it during the crawl for others to see.

in the historical projects, yarn companies provided knitting patterns approved by the various branches of the armed services; often they were distributed by local chapters of the american red cross.

yarn companies offer free knitting patterns for these caps.

depending on the yarn and knitting pattern, knitted garments can stretch as much as 500%.

basic pattern of warp knitting.

[6] a modern knitting machine in the process of weft knitting weft-knit fabrics may also be knit with multiple yarns, usually to produce interesting color patterns.

patterns and pictures can be created in knitted fabrics by using knit and purl stitches as "pixels"; however, such pixels are usually rectangular, rather than square, depending on the gauge/tension of the knitting.

short and tall stitches may also alternate within a row, forming a fish-like oval pattern.

alternating rows of all knit stitches and all purl stitches creates a stockinette pattern/stocking stitch.

checkerboard patterns (basketweave) are also possible, the smallest of which is known as seed/moss stitch: the stitches alternate between knit and purl in every wale and along every row.

mosaic knitting is a form of slip-stitch knitting that knits alternate colored rows and uses slip stitches to form patterns; mosaic-knit fabrics tend to be stiffer than patterned fabrics produced by other methods such as fair-isle knitting.

new wales can be begun from any of the edges of a knitted fabric; this is known as picking up stitches and is the basis for entrelac, in which the wales run perpendicular to one another in a checkerboard pattern.

however, this need not be so, since the order in which stitches are knitted may be permuted so that wales cross over one another, forming a cable pattern.

cable patterns tend to draw the fabric together, making it denser and less elastic;[10] aran sweaters are a common form of knitted cabling.

[11] arbitrarily complex braid patterns can be done in cable knitting, with the proviso that the wales must move ever upwards; it is generally impossible for a wale to move up and then down the fabric.

in lace knitting, the pattern is formed by making small, stable holes in the fabric, generally with yarn overs.

this is used to great effect in lace knitting, which consists of making patterns and pictures using such holes, rather than with the stitches themselves.

additional patterns can be made on the surface of the knitted fabric using embroidery; if the embroidery resembles knitting, it is often called swiss darning.

separately knitted tubes can be applied to a knitted fabric to form complex celtic knots and other patterns that would be difficult to knit.

because there is no single straight line of yarn anywhere in the pattern, a knitted piece of fabric can stretch in all directions.

many modern stretchy garments, even as they rely on elastic synthetic materials for some stretch, also achieve at least some of their stretch through knitted patterns.

close-up of front of stockinette stitch close-up of back of stockinette stitch, also same appearance as reverse stockinette stitch the basic knitted fabric (as in the diagram, and usually called a stocking or stockinette pattern) has a definite "right side" and "wrong side".

(despite being the "wrong side", reverse stockinette is frequently used as a pattern in its own right.)

stitches can be worked from either side, and various patterns are created by mixing regular knit stitches with the "wrong side" stitches, known as purl stitches, either in columns (ribbing), rows (garter, welting), or more complex patterns.

adding a "slip stitch" (where a loop is passed from one needle to the other) allows for a wide range of textures, including heel and linen stitches as well as a number of more complicated patterns.

changing the order of stitches from one row to the next, usually with the help of a cable needle or stitch holder, is key to cable knitting, producing an endless variety of cables, honeycombs, ropes, and aran sweater patterning.

fair isle knitting uses two or more colored yarns to create patterns and forms a thicker and less flexible fabric.

more complicated techniques permit large fields of color (intarsia, for example), busy small-scale patterns of color (such as fair isle), or both (double knitting and slip-stitch color, for example).

the thickness or weight of the yarn is a significant factor in determining the gauge/tension, i.e., how many stitches and rows are required to cover a given area for a given stitch pattern.

patterns and motifs are coarser with thicker yarns; thicker yarns produce bold visual effects, whereas thinner yarns are best for refined patterns.

a key factor in knitting is stitch definition, corresponding to how well complicated stitch patterns can be seen when made from a given yarn.

smooth, highly spun yarns are best for showing off stitch patterns; at the other extreme, very fuzzy yarns or eyelash yarns have poor stitch definition, and any complicated stitch pattern would be invisible.

variegated yarns can produce interesting visual effects, such as diagonal stripes; conversely, a variegated yarn may obscure a detailed knitting design, such as a cable or lace pattern.

at specific points indicated by the knitting pattern, the cable needle is moved, the stitches on it are worked by the other needles, then the cable needle is turned around to a different position to create the cable twist.

for large or complex knitting patterns, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of which stitch should be knit in a particular way; therefore, several tools have been developed to identify the number of a particular row or stitch, including circular stitch markers, hanging markers, extra yarn and row counters.

patterns are created on the outside (public-facing) side of the piece.
