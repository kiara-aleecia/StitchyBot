illustration of cable knitting.

the central braid is formed from 2x2 ribbing in which the background is formed of purl stitches and the cables are each two wales of knit stitches.

cables, increases, and lace[edit] see also: list of knitting stitches ordinarily, stitches are knitted in the same order in every row, and the wales of the fabric run parallel and vertically along the fabric.

however, this need not be so, since the order in which stitches are knitted may be permuted so that wales cross over one another, forming a cable pattern.

cable patterns tend to draw the fabric together, making it denser and less elastic;[10] aran sweaters are a common form of knitted cabling.

[11] arbitrarily complex braid patterns can be done in cable knitting, with the proviso that the wales must move ever upwards; it is generally impossible for a wale to move up and then down the fabric.

changing the order of stitches from one row to the next, usually with the help of a cable needle or stitch holder, is key to cable knitting, producing an endless variety of cables, honeycombs, ropes, and aran sweater patterning.

there are various methods employed to cast on, such as the "thumb method" (also known as "slingshot" or "long-tail" cast-ons), where the stitches are created by a series of loops that will, when knitted, give a very loose edge ideal for "picking up stitches" and knitting a border; the "double needle method" (also known as "knit-on" or "cable cast-on"), whereby each loop placed on the needle is then "knitted on", which produces a firmer edge ideal on its own as a border; and many more.

plied yarns may themselves be plied together, producing cabled yarns or multi-stranded yarns.

variegated yarns can produce interesting visual effects, such as diagonal stripes; conversely, a variegated yarn may obscure a detailed knitting design, such as a cable or lace pattern.

they are kits consist of pairs of needles with usually nylon cables or cords.

the cables/cords are screwed into the needles, allowing the knitter to have both flexible straight needles or circular needles.

cable needles are a special case of dpns, although they are usually not straight, but dimpled in the middle.

cable needles are typically very short (a few inches), and are used to hold stitches temporarily while others are being knitted.

when in use, the cable needle is used at the same time as two regular needles.

at specific points indicated by the knitting pattern, the cable needle is moved, the stitches on it are worked by the other needles, then the cable needle is turned around to a different position to create the cable twist.

cable needles cable needles are a specific design, and are used to create the twisting motif of a knitted cable.

they are made in different sizes, which produces cables of different widths.

starting from the bottom right are two crochet hooks, two stitch holders (like big blunt safety pins), and two cable needles in pink and green.

7cables , increases , and lace 1 .

illustration of cable knitting .

the central braid is formed from 2x2 ribbing in which the background is formed of purl stitches and the cables are each two wales of knit stitches .

cables , increases , and lace [ edit ] see also : list of knitting stitches ordinarily , stitches are knitted in the same order in every row , and the wales of the fabric run parallel and vertically along the fabric .

however , this need not be so , since the order in which stitches are knitted may be permuted so that wales cross over one another , forming a cable pattern .

cable patterns tend to draw the fabric together , making it denser and less elastic ;[ 10 ] aran sweaters are a common form of knitted cabling .

[ 11 ] arbitrarily complex braid patterns can be done in cable knitting , with the proviso that the wales must move ever upwards ; it is generally impossible for a wale to move up and then down the fabric .

changing the order of stitches from one row to the next , usually with the help of a cable needle or stitch holder , is key to cable knitting , producing an endless variety of cables , honeycombs , ropes , and aran sweater patterning .

there are various methods employed to cast on , such as the " thumb method " ( also known as " slingshot " or " long - tail " cast - ons ), where the stitches are created by a series of loops that will , when knitted , give a very loose edge ideal for " picking up stitches " and knitting a border ; the " double needle method " ( also known as " knit - on " or " cable cast - on "), whereby each loop placed on the needle is then " knitted on ", which produces a firmer edge ideal on its own as a border ; and many more .

plied yarns may themselves be plied together , producing cabled yarns or multi - stranded yarns .

variegated yarns can produce interesting visual effects , such as diagonal stripes ; conversely , a variegated yarn may obscure a detailed knitting design , such as a cable or lace pattern .

they are kits consist of pairs of needles with usually nylon cables or cords .

the cables / cords are screwed into the needles , allowing the knitter to have both flexible straight needles or circular needles .

cable needles are a special case of dpns , although they are usually not straight , but dimpled in the middle .

cable needles are typically very short ( a few inches ), and are used to hold stitches temporarily while others are being knitted .

when in use , the cable needle is used at the same time as two regular needles .

at specific points indicated by the knitting pattern , the cable needle is moved , the stitches on it are worked by the other needles , then the cable needle is turned around to a different position to create the cable twist .

cable needles cable needles are a specific design , and are used to create the twisting motif of a knitted cable .

they are made in different sizes , which produces cables of different widths .

starting from the bottom right are two crochet hooks , two stitch holders ( like big blunt safety pins ), and two cable needles in pink and green .
