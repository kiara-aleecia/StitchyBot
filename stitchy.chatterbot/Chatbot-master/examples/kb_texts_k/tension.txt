patterns and pictures can be created in knitted fabrics by using knit and purl stitches as "pixels"; however, such pixels are usually rectangular, rather than square, depending on the gauge/tension of the knitting.

care must be taken to bind off at a tension that will allow the "give" needed to comfortably fit on the head.

skeins and balls are generally sold with a yarn-band, a label that describes the yarn's weight, length, dye lot, fiber content, washing instructions, suggested needle size, likely gauge/tension, etc.

the thickness or weight of the yarn is a significant factor in determining the gauge/tension, i.e., how many stitches and rows are required to cover a given area for a given stitch pattern.

a yarn's usefulness for a knitting project is judged by several factors, such as its loft (its ability to trap air), its resilience (elasticity under tension), its washability and colorfastness, its hand (its feel, particularly softness vs. scratchiness), its durability against abrasion, its resistance to pilling, its hairiness (fuzziness), its tendency to twist or untwist, its overall weight and drape, its blocking and felting qualities, its comfort (breathability, moisture absorption, wicking properties) and of course its look, which includes its color, sheen, smoothness and ornamental features.

more resilient yarns are more forgiving of irregularities in tension; highly twisted yarns are sometimes difficult to knit, whereas untwisting yarns can lead to split stitches, in which not all the yarn is knitted into a stitch.

in spinning, the fibers are twisted so that the yarn resists breaking under tension; the twisting may be done in either direction, resulting in a z-twist or s-twist yarn.

in general, yarns become stronger with more twist (also called worst), longer fibers and thicker yarns (more fibers); for example, thinner yarns require more twist than do thicker yarns to resist breaking under tension.

the diameter affects the size of stitches, which affects the gauge/tension of the knitting and the elasticity of the fabric.

thus, a simple way to change gauge/tension is to use different needles, which is the basis of uneven knitting.

whether it's tension, your personal knitting gauge, or the way you wrap your yarn around your fingers.

many knitters who use this style hold their working needle like a pencil, which frees up their pointer finger to hold the tension of their yarn and "flick" it around the end of the needle.

portuguese knitting is an especially unique knitting hold because the tension of the yarn is not held in the hands at all.

in every other knitting style, the tension is held in the hands; this gives your hands two jobs to do at the same time -- holding the yarn and working the stitches with the needles.

when the tension is held around the neck, there's one less thing you have to worry about when making your stitches.

if knitting with the yarn around your neck is a little too out of the box for you, you can also get a portuguese knitting pin that attaches to your shirt and holds the tension there.

because the dominant hand doesn't have to worry about holding the tension of the yarn and the working needle at the same time, this style of knitting is much faster.
