patterns and pictures can be created in knitted fabrics by using knit and purl stitches as " pixels "; however , such pixels are usually rectangular , rather than square , depending on the gauge / tension of the knitting .

fabrics in which each knitted row is followed by a purled row , such as in stockinette / stocking stitch , have a tendency to curl — top and bottom curl toward the front ( or knitted side ) while the sides curl toward the back ( or purled side ); by contrast , those in which knit and purl stitches are arranged symmetrically ( such as ribbing , garter stitch or seed / moss stitch ) have more texture and tend to lie flat .

thus , the purl wales in ribbing tend to be invisible , since the neighboring knit wales come forward .

stitches can be worked from either side , and various patterns are created by mixing regular knit stitches with the " wrong side " stitches , known as purl stitches , either in columns ( ribbing ), rows ( garter , welting ), or more complex patterns .

different combinations of knit and purl stitches , along with more advanced techniques , generate fabrics of considerably variable consistency , from gauzy to very dense , from highly stretchy to relatively stiff , from flat to tightly curled , and so on .
