knitting creates stitches: loops of yarn in a row, either flat or in the round (tubular).

knitted fabric consists of a number of consecutive rows of connected loops that intermesh with the next and previous rows.

as each row is formed, each newly created loop is pulled through one or more loops from the prior row and placed on the gaining needle so that the loops from the prior row can be pulled off the other needle without unraveling.

the uppermost white loops are unsecured and "active", but they secure the red loops suspended from them.

in turn, the red loops secure the white loops just below them, which in turn secure the loops below them, and so on.

by contrast, the yarn in knitted fabrics follows a meandering path (a course), forming symmetric loops (also called bights) symmetrically above and below the mean path of the yarn.

these meandering loops can be easily stretched in different directions giving knit fabrics much more elasticity than woven fabrics.

if they are not secured, the loops of a knitted course will come undone when their yarn is pulled; this is known as ripping out, unravelling knitting, or humorously, frogging (because you 'rip it', this sounds like a frog croaking: 'rib-bit').

[1] to secure a stitch, at least one new loop is passed through it.

parallel yarns zigzag lengthwise along the fabric, each loop securing a loop of an adjacent strand from the previous row.

in the knit stitch on the left, the next (red) loop passes through the previous (yellow) loop from below, whereas in the purl stitch (right), the next stitch enters from above.

a dropped stitch, or missed stitch, is a common error that creates an extra loop to be fixed.

in securing the previous stitch in a wale, the next stitch can pass through the previous loop from either below or above.

individual stitches, or rows of stitches, may be made taller by drawing more yarn into the new loop (an elongated stitch), which is the basis for uneven knitting: a row of tall stitches may alternate with one or more rows of short stitches for an interesting visual effect.

[7] typically, a new stitch is passed through a single unsecured ('active') loop, thus lengthening that wale by one stitch.

however, this need not be so; the new loop may be passed through an already secured stitch lower down on the fabric, or even between secured stitches (a dip stitch).

depending on the distance between where the loop is drawn through the fabric and where it is knitted, dip stitches can produce a subtle stippling or long lines across the surface of the fabric, e.g., the lower leaves of a flower.

the new loop may also be passed between two stitches in the 'present' row, thus clustering the intervening stitches; this approach is often used to produce a smocking effect in the fabric.

the new loop may also be passed through 'two or more' previous stitches, producing a decrease and merging wales together.

when knitting, a pair of long needles is needed to be able to form the loops from one set of loop to another through the needles.

when crocheting, only one single hook is used to be able to hook the loops together directly onto the clothes.

hand-knitters generally produce right-plaited stitches by knitting or purling through the back loops, i.e., passing the needle through the initial stitch in an unusual way, but wrapping the yarn as usual.

long loops can also be drawn out and secured, forming a "shaggy" texture to the fabric; this is known as loop knitting.

unlike woven fabrics, where strands usually run straight horizontally and vertically, yarn that has been knitted follows a looped path along its row, as with the red strand in the diagram at left, in which the loops of one row have all been pulled through the loops of the row below it.

on the right side, the visible portions of the loops are the verticals connecting two rows which are arranged in a grid of v shapes.

on the wrong side, the ends of the loops are visible, both the tops and bottoms, creating a much more bumpy texture sometimes called reverse stockinette.

adding a "slip stitch" (where a loop is passed from one needle to the other) allows for a wide range of textures, including heel and linen stitches as well as a number of more complicated patterns.

there are various methods employed to cast on, such as the "thumb method" (also known as "slingshot" or "long-tail" cast-ons), where the stitches are created by a series of loops that will, when knitted, give a very loose edge ideal for "picking up stitches" and knitting a border; the "double needle method" (also known as "knit-on" or "cable cast-on"), whereby each loop placed on the needle is then "knitted on", which produces a firmer edge ideal on its own as a border; and many more.

casting (or "binding") off loops the stitches across each other so they can be removed from the needle without unravelling the item.

sometimes, the yarns being plied are fed at different rates, so that one yarn loops around the other, as in bouclé.
