knitted garments are often more form-fitting than woven garments, since their elasticity allows them to contour to the body's outline more closely; by contrast, curvature is introduced into most woven garments only with sewn darts, flares, gussets and gores, the seams of which lower the elasticity of the woven fabric still further.

extra curvature can be introduced into knitted garments without seams, as in the heel of a sock; the effect of darts, flares, etc.

the upper red course is purled into the row below and then is knit, consistent with 'garter' stitch.

in the simplest of hand-knitted fabrics, every row of stitches are all knit (or all purl); this creates a garter stitch fabric.

fabrics in which each knitted row is followed by a purled row, such as in stockinette/stocking stitch, have a tendency to curl—top and bottom curl toward the front (or knitted side) while the sides curl toward the back (or purled side); by contrast, those in which knit and purl stitches are arranged symmetrically (such as ribbing, garter stitch or seed/moss stitch) have more texture and tend to lie flat.

for example, a stitch slipped for one row before knitting would be roughly twice as tall as its knitted counterparts.

history and culture[edit] main article: history of knitting the word is derived from knot and ultimately from the old english cnyttan, to knot.

[13] the exact origins of knitting are unknown, the earliest known examples being cotton socks found in the remains of the city of fustat, now part of cairo.

his collection of books about knitting is now housed at the winchester school of art (university of southampton).

properties of fabrics[edit] main article: knitted fabric schematic of stockinette stitch, the most basic weft-knit fabric the topology of a knitted fabric is relatively complex.

stitches can be worked from either side, and various patterns are created by mixing regular knit stitches with the "wrong side" stitches, known as purl stitches, either in columns (ribbing), rows (garter, welting), or more complex patterns.

each fabric has different properties: a garter stitch has much more vertical stretch, while ribbing stretches much more horizontally.

other simple textures can be made with nothing but knit and purl stitches, including garter stitch, ribbing, and moss and seed stitches.

in hand knitting certain articles of clothing, especially larger ones like sweaters, the final knitted garment will be made of several knitted pieces, with individual sections of the garment hand knitted separately and then sewn together.

hats in particular can be started "top down" on double pointed needles with the increases added until the preferred size is achieved, switching to an appropriate circular needle when enough stitches have been added.

materials[edit] yarn[edit] main article: yarn a hank of wool yarn (center) is uncoiled into its basic loop.

a yarn's usefulness for a knitting project is judged by several factors, such as its loft (its ability to trap air), its resilience (elasticity under tension), its washability and colorfastness, its hand (its feel, particularly softness vs. scratchiness), its durability against abrasion, its resistance to pilling, its hairiness (fuzziness), its tendency to twist or untwist, its overall weight and drape, its blocking and felting qualities, its comfort (breathability, moisture absorption, wicking properties) and of course its look, which includes its color, sheen, smoothness and ornamental features.

the dyeing of yarns is a complex art that has a long history.

needles[edit] main article: knitting needle knitting needles in a variety of sizes and materials.

although the diameter of the knitting needle is often measured in millimeters, there are several measurement systems, particularly those specific to the united states, the united kingdom and japan; a conversion table is given at knitting needle.

starting from the bottom right are two crochet hooks, two stitch holders (like big blunt safety pins), and two cable needles in pink and green.

for large or complex knitting patterns, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of which stitch should be knit in a particular way; therefore, several tools have been developed to identify the number of a particular row or stitch, including circular stitch markers, hanging markers, extra yarn and row counters.

knitting styles/holds[edit] continental/german style[edit] main article: continental knitting continental knitting is achieved by holding the yarn in your left hand for both knitting and purling.

norwegian style[edit] main article: norwegian knitting while knit stitches are worked as in the classic continental style, the purl is worked by leaving the yarn at back and moving the needle.

english style[edit] main article: english knitting english-style knitting is achieved by holding the yarn in your right hand.

double knitting[edit] main article: double knittinga technique used to create a flat, smooth, reversible fabric that looks like stockinette or jersey on both sides, rather than having a knit face and a purl reverse side.

fair isle[edit] main article: fair isle (technique) a method by which many different yarns are used throughout the row and when not being used are floated on the wrong side of the piece.

[27][28][29] she has published bugknits: extreme knitting for hobbyists, artists and knitters (2009, blurb: isbn 978-1320025546).

[30][31] short row[edit] main article: short row (knitting) in short row knitting, the work is turned before a row is fully knitted.

twined knitting[edit] main article: twined knitting the technique, also known as two-end knitting, is a traditional scandinavian knitting technique.

for individual hobbyists, websites such as etsy, big cartel and ravelry have made it easy to sell knitting patterns on a small scale, in a way similar to ebay.

graffiti[edit] main article: yarn bombing in the 2000s, a practice called knitting graffiti, guerilla knitting, or yarn bombing—the use of knitted or crocheted cloth to modify and beautify one's (usually outdoor) surroundings—emerged in the u.s. and spread worldwide.

[32] magda sayeg is credited with starting the movement in the us and knit the city are a prominent group of graffiti knitters in the united kingdom.

for instance, dave cole is a contemporary sculpture artist who practiced knitting as graffiti for a large-scale public art installation in melbourne, australia for the big west arts festival in 2009. the work was vandalized the night of its completion.

[34] a new movie, shot by a tasmanian filmmaker on a set made almost entirely out of yarn, was partially inspired by "knitted graffiti".

over the multi-day period, multiple local yarn and knit shops participate in the yarn crawl and offer up store discounts, give away free exclusive patterns, provide classes, trunk shows and conduct raffles for prizes.

participants of the crawl receive a passport and get their passport stamped at each store they visit along the crawl.

[36][37][38][39] charity[edit] drawing by marguerite martyn of two women and a child knitting for the war effort at a st. louis, missouri, red cross office in 1917 hand knitting garments for free distribution to others has become common practice among hand knitting groups.

[41] originally started after the 2004 indonesian tsunami, knitters without borders[42] is a charity challenge issued by knitting personality stephanie pearl-mcphee that encourages hand knitters to donate to médecins sans frontières (doctors without borders).

the project was started in memory of a young woman who had collected plastic toy ducks and who died from cystic fibrosis while waiting for a lung transplant.

these studies have found the rhythmic and repetitive action of hand knitting can help prevent and manage stress, pain and depression, which in turn strengthens the body's immune system,[47] as well as create a relaxation response in the body which can decrease blood pressure, heart rate, help prevent illness, and have a calming effect.

this keeps the fingers limber and can be especially helpful for those with arthritis.

knitting can reduce the pain of arthritis if people make it a daily habit.

knitted garments are often more form-fitting than woven garments, since their elasticity allows them to contour to the body's outline more closely; by contrast, curvature is introduced into most woven garments only with sewn darts, flares, gussets and gores, the seams of which lower the elasticity of the woven fabric still further.

extra curvature can be introduced into knitted garments without seams, as in the heel of a sock; the effect of darts, flares, etc.

the upper red course is purled into the row below and then is knit, consistent with 'garter' stitch.

in the simplest of hand-knitted fabrics, every row of stitches are all knit (or all purl); this creates a garter stitch fabric.

fabrics in which each knitted row is followed by a purled row, such as in stockinette/stocking stitch, have a tendency to curl—top and bottom curl toward the front (or knitted side) while the sides curl toward the back (or purled side); by contrast, those in which knit and purl stitches are arranged symmetrically (such as ribbing, garter stitch or seed/moss stitch) have more texture and tend to lie flat.

for example, a stitch slipped for one row before knitting would be roughly twice as tall as its knitted counterparts.

history and culture[edit] main article: history of knitting the word is derived from knot and ultimately from the old english cnyttan, to knot.

[13] the exact origins of knitting are unknown, the earliest known examples being cotton socks found in the remains of the city of fustat, now part of cairo.

his collection of books about knitting is now housed at the winchester school of art (university of southampton).

properties of fabrics[edit] main article: knitted fabric schematic of stockinette stitch, the most basic weft-knit fabric the topology of a knitted fabric is relatively complex.

stitches can be worked from either side, and various patterns are created by mixing regular knit stitches with the "wrong side" stitches, known as purl stitches, either in columns (ribbing), rows (garter, welting), or more complex patterns.

each fabric has different properties: a garter stitch has much more vertical stretch, while ribbing stretches much more horizontally.

other simple textures can be made with nothing but knit and purl stitches, including garter stitch, ribbing, and moss and seed stitches.

in hand knitting certain articles of clothing, especially larger ones like sweaters, the final knitted garment will be made of several knitted pieces, with individual sections of the garment hand knitted separately and then sewn together.

hats in particular can be started "top down" on double pointed needles with the increases added until the preferred size is achieved, switching to an appropriate circular needle when enough stitches have been added.

materials[edit] yarn[edit] main article: yarn a hank of wool yarn (center) is uncoiled into its basic loop.

a yarn's usefulness for a knitting project is judged by several factors, such as its loft (its ability to trap air), its resilience (elasticity under tension), its washability and colorfastness, its hand (its feel, particularly softness vs. scratchiness), its durability against abrasion, its resistance to pilling, its hairiness (fuzziness), its tendency to twist or untwist, its overall weight and drape, its blocking and felting qualities, its comfort (breathability, moisture absorption, wicking properties) and of course its look, which includes its color, sheen, smoothness and ornamental features.

the dyeing of yarns is a complex art that has a long history.

needles[edit] main article: knitting needle knitting needles in a variety of sizes and materials.

although the diameter of the knitting needle is often measured in millimeters, there are several measurement systems, particularly those specific to the united states, the united kingdom and japan; a conversion table is given at knitting needle.

starting from the bottom right are two crochet hooks, two stitch holders (like big blunt safety pins), and two cable needles in pink and green.

for large or complex knitting patterns, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of which stitch should be knit in a particular way; therefore, several tools have been developed to identify the number of a particular row or stitch, including circular stitch markers, hanging markers, extra yarn and row counters.

knitting styles/holds[edit] continental/german style[edit] main article: continental knitting continental knitting is achieved by holding the yarn in your left hand for both knitting and purling.

norwegian style[edit] main article: norwegian knitting while knit stitches are worked as in the classic continental style, the purl is worked by leaving the yarn at back and moving the needle.

english style[edit] main article: english knitting english-style knitting is achieved by holding the yarn in your right hand.

double knitting[edit] main article: double knittinga technique used to create a flat, smooth, reversible fabric that looks like stockinette or jersey on both sides, rather than having a knit face and a purl reverse side.

fair isle[edit] main article: fair isle (technique) a method by which many different yarns are used throughout the row and when not being used are floated on the wrong side of the piece.

[27][28][29] she has published bugknits: extreme knitting for hobbyists, artists and knitters (2009, blurb: isbn 978-1320025546).

[30][31] short row[edit] main article: short row (knitting) in short row knitting, the work is turned before a row is fully knitted.

twined knitting[edit] main article: twined knitting the technique, also known as two-end knitting, is a traditional scandinavian knitting technique.

for individual hobbyists, websites such as etsy, big cartel and ravelry have made it easy to sell knitting patterns on a small scale, in a way similar to ebay.

graffiti[edit] main article: yarn bombing in the 2000s, a practice called knitting graffiti, guerilla knitting, or yarn bombing—the use of knitted or crocheted cloth to modify and beautify one's (usually outdoor) surroundings—emerged in the u.s. and spread worldwide.

[32] magda sayeg is credited with starting the movement in the us and knit the city are a prominent group of graffiti knitters in the united kingdom.

for instance, dave cole is a contemporary sculpture artist who practiced knitting as graffiti for a large-scale public art installation in melbourne, australia for the big west arts festival in 2009. the work was vandalized the night of its completion.

[34] a new movie, shot by a tasmanian filmmaker on a set made almost entirely out of yarn, was partially inspired by "knitted graffiti".

over the multi-day period, multiple local yarn and knit shops participate in the yarn crawl and offer up store discounts, give away free exclusive patterns, provide classes, trunk shows and conduct raffles for prizes.

participants of the crawl receive a passport and get their passport stamped at each store they visit along the crawl.

[36][37][38][39] charity[edit] drawing by marguerite martyn of two women and a child knitting for the war effort at a st. louis, missouri, red cross office in 1917 hand knitting garments for free distribution to others has become common practice among hand knitting groups.

[41] originally started after the 2004 indonesian tsunami, knitters without borders[42] is a charity challenge issued by knitting personality stephanie pearl-mcphee that encourages hand knitters to donate to médecins sans frontières (doctors without borders).

the project was started in memory of a young woman who had collected plastic toy ducks and who died from cystic fibrosis while waiting for a lung transplant.

these studies have found the rhythmic and repetitive action of hand knitting can help prevent and manage stress, pain and depression, which in turn strengthens the body's immune system,[47] as well as create a relaxation response in the body which can decrease blood pressure, heart rate, help prevent illness, and have a calming effect.

this keeps the fingers limber and can be especially helpful for those with arthritis.

knitting can reduce the pain of arthritis if people make it a daily habit.

knitted garments are often more form-fitting than woven garments, since their elasticity allows them to contour to the body's outline more closely; by contrast, curvature is introduced into most woven garments only with sewn darts, flares, gussets and gores, the seams of which lower the elasticity of the woven fabric still further.

extra curvature can be introduced into knitted garments without seams, as in the heel of a sock; the effect of darts, flares, etc.

the upper red course is purled into the row below and then is knit, consistent with 'garter' stitch.

in the simplest of hand-knitted fabrics, every row of stitches are all knit (or all purl); this creates a garter stitch fabric.

fabrics in which each knitted row is followed by a purled row, such as in stockinette/stocking stitch, have a tendency to curl—top and bottom curl toward the front (or knitted side) while the sides curl toward the back (or purled side); by contrast, those in which knit and purl stitches are arranged symmetrically (such as ribbing, garter stitch or seed/moss stitch) have more texture and tend to lie flat.

for example, a stitch slipped for one row before knitting would be roughly twice as tall as its knitted counterparts.

history and culture[edit] main article: history of knitting the word is derived from knot and ultimately from the old english cnyttan, to knot.

[13] the exact origins of knitting are unknown, the earliest known examples being cotton socks found in the remains of the city of fustat, now part of cairo.

his collection of books about knitting is now housed at the winchester school of art (university of southampton).

properties of fabrics[edit] main article: knitted fabric schematic of stockinette stitch, the most basic weft-knit fabric the topology of a knitted fabric is relatively complex.

stitches can be worked from either side, and various patterns are created by mixing regular knit stitches with the "wrong side" stitches, known as purl stitches, either in columns (ribbing), rows (garter, welting), or more complex patterns.

each fabric has different properties: a garter stitch has much more vertical stretch, while ribbing stretches much more horizontally.

other simple textures can be made with nothing but knit and purl stitches, including garter stitch, ribbing, and moss and seed stitches.

in hand knitting certain articles of clothing, especially larger ones like sweaters, the final knitted garment will be made of several knitted pieces, with individual sections of the garment hand knitted separately and then sewn together.

hats in particular can be started "top down" on double pointed needles with the increases added until the preferred size is achieved, switching to an appropriate circular needle when enough stitches have been added.

materials[edit] yarn[edit] main article: yarn a hank of wool yarn (center) is uncoiled into its basic loop.

a yarn's usefulness for a knitting project is judged by several factors, such as its loft (its ability to trap air), its resilience (elasticity under tension), its washability and colorfastness, its hand (its feel, particularly softness vs. scratchiness), its durability against abrasion, its resistance to pilling, its hairiness (fuzziness), its tendency to twist or untwist, its overall weight and drape, its blocking and felting qualities, its comfort (breathability, moisture absorption, wicking properties) and of course its look, which includes its color, sheen, smoothness and ornamental features.

the dyeing of yarns is a complex art that has a long history.

needles[edit] main article: knitting needle knitting needles in a variety of sizes and materials.

although the diameter of the knitting needle is often measured in millimeters, there are several measurement systems, particularly those specific to the united states, the united kingdom and japan; a conversion table is given at knitting needle.

starting from the bottom right are two crochet hooks, two stitch holders (like big blunt safety pins), and two cable needles in pink and green.

for large or complex knitting patterns, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of which stitch should be knit in a particular way; therefore, several tools have been developed to identify the number of a particular row or stitch, including circular stitch markers, hanging markers, extra yarn and row counters.

knitting styles/holds[edit] continental/german style[edit] main article: continental knitting continental knitting is achieved by holding the yarn in your left hand for both knitting and purling.

norwegian style[edit] main article: norwegian knitting while knit stitches are worked as in the classic continental style, the purl is worked by leaving the yarn at back and moving the needle.

english style[edit] main article: english knitting english-style knitting is achieved by holding the yarn in your right hand.

double knitting[edit] main article: double knittinga technique used to create a flat, smooth, reversible fabric that looks like stockinette or jersey on both sides, rather than having a knit face and a purl reverse side.

fair isle[edit] main article: fair isle (technique) a method by which many different yarns are used throughout the row and when not being used are floated on the wrong side of the piece.

[27][28][29] she has published bugknits: extreme knitting for hobbyists, artists and knitters (2009, blurb: isbn 978-1320025546).

[30][31] short row[edit] main article: short row (knitting) in short row knitting, the work is turned before a row is fully knitted.

twined knitting[edit] main article: twined knitting the technique, also known as two-end knitting, is a traditional scandinavian knitting technique.

for individual hobbyists, websites such as etsy, big cartel and ravelry have made it easy to sell knitting patterns on a small scale, in a way similar to ebay.

graffiti[edit] main article: yarn bombing in the 2000s, a practice called knitting graffiti, guerilla knitting, or yarn bombing—the use of knitted or crocheted cloth to modify and beautify one's (usually outdoor) surroundings—emerged in the u.s. and spread worldwide.

[32] magda sayeg is credited with starting the movement in the us and knit the city are a prominent group of graffiti knitters in the united kingdom.

for instance, dave cole is a contemporary sculpture artist who practiced knitting as graffiti for a large-scale public art installation in melbourne, australia for the big west arts festival in 2009. the work was vandalized the night of its completion.

[34] a new movie, shot by a tasmanian filmmaker on a set made almost entirely out of yarn, was partially inspired by "knitted graffiti".

over the multi-day period, multiple local yarn and knit shops participate in the yarn crawl and offer up store discounts, give away free exclusive patterns, provide classes, trunk shows and conduct raffles for prizes.

participants of the crawl receive a passport and get their passport stamped at each store they visit along the crawl.

[36][37][38][39] charity[edit] drawing by marguerite martyn of two women and a child knitting for the war effort at a st. louis, missouri, red cross office in 1917 hand knitting garments for free distribution to others has become common practice among hand knitting groups.

[41] originally started after the 2004 indonesian tsunami, knitters without borders[42] is a charity challenge issued by knitting personality stephanie pearl-mcphee that encourages hand knitters to donate to médecins sans frontières (doctors without borders).

the project was started in memory of a young woman who had collected plastic toy ducks and who died from cystic fibrosis while waiting for a lung transplant.

these studies have found the rhythmic and repetitive action of hand knitting can help prevent and manage stress, pain and depression, which in turn strengthens the body's immune system,[47] as well as create a relaxation response in the body which can decrease blood pressure, heart rate, help prevent illness, and have a calming effect.

this keeps the fingers limber and can be especially helpful for those with arthritis.

knitting can reduce the pain of arthritis if people make it a daily habit.
