Materials are being X-rayed, examined under microscopes, photographed, and documented. Stitches studied and cross-referenced. Specialists summoned for expert advice and fibre samples taken. Sponges dabbed, frayed edges inspected. And mysteries slowly unravelled.Who was the 12-year-old girl, born in the 1640s, who spent two years embroidering this square of linen? How did her delicate hands work with a needle and thread so fine we have nothing to compare them to today? What was she thinking of as she sketched a scene that depicts a royal coupling set amid castles, country houses and a magical garden of exotic birds and flowers? Did the vicar come to her house, as she sat with her mother and sisters, to read from the Bible as they sewed? And did she fret, as literature of the time suggests, as she embellished her cloth with coral, pearls and peacock feathers, that she mightn't marry well if her purling wasn't perfect? Details of a panel of King Charles I and Henrietta Maria (mid-17th century) done by a 12-year-old girl. It is composed of silk, linen, paper, metal, pearls, coral, wood, and cotton wadding.Credit: NGVIn the many quiet, careful hours conservators Kate Douglas and Kate McLaren have spent with each of the 40 pieces for Exquisite Threads: English Embroidery, there has been plenty of time for such musings. They have studied and noted each tiny stitch, marvelled at the complexity of layers, methods and materials used, and been enthralled by the playful imagination of their creators. But the exhibition, which spans more than 400 years of English embroidery, is not only a celebration of clever stitches. It's also a rare window into the lives of their creators, many of whose identities – like our masterful 12-year-old – remain unknown. It is also a story of the role of embroidery in English culture, as a skill that marked a girl's path into womanhood, a craft that conveyed rank and social standing, and a pastime that captured chapters of history with personal flourishes. Yes, there is an apron, a bible cover, a wall hanging, but in each depiction there is also an ornate portal to another age. To this end, the exhibition's story is told in three chapters: home, fashion and education. Home for the coverlets and bedding that transformed four-poster beds into elaborate kingdoms of slumber amid floral motifs. Fashion for the capes well-to-do ladies wore over their perfectly tailored evening gowns, and the handbags they needed when slim silhouettes were adopted and there was no place for pockets in the back of one's voluminous skirt. Education for the samplers, passed down through the generations, so that mothers could teach their daughters to sew.

As a girl she would start with samplers, learning stitches and perfecting them before moving onto more complex, sophisticated panels." These panels often drew on stories from the bible or royal history – look out for severed heads and crows flying off with cows in their beaks. Far from flights of whimsy, these scenes demonstrate knowledge of specific historical events and, occasionally, pointed commentary on the characters involved. If you know the codes, says Di Trocchio, the seemingly haphazard placement of a sun by a figure's head or the inclusion of an oak leaf or a carnation conveys a subtle message. The age of various pieces can also be determined by the symbols depicted. As trade commences between Europe and Asia in the 17th century, exotic motifs such as tropical birds, even lions, begin to appear. Later, patterns borrowed from Japanese porcelain and textiles from India and Turkey emerge, as do exotic silks and fabrics. Di Trocchio's favourite piece is an embroidered writing box, each of its six sides depicting chapters from the Bible. It's likely the product of several years of work; once completed it was sent to a cabinet maker who spent another two years crafting the box. She's also fond of an apron from the 1720s, which, she's happy to concede, is unlikely to have ever seen the inside of a kitchen. "The more decorative your apron, the less work you did," says e McLaren.It was sewn at a time when Europe's rich and powerful had gardens filled with exotic trophies from faraway lands. Each time adventurers returned from voyages, extraordinary bounty came with them. This was the heyday of botany, the only scientific discipline genteel, educated women were permitted to study. And they did – replicating it in paintings and stitches with scientific precision. The wearer of this apron, as with the creators of much of this embroidery, were ladies of a certain standing: upper middle-class, their days divided into spells of singing, dancing, painting and, no doubt, gossip.

"Aprons could be adorned with signs of rank much like a military uniform is."Moreover, the mistress of the house would bequeath her most cherished apron to her favorite child.Exhibits from Exquisite Threads.Credit: NGVWhile many works bear no note of their maker, others feature entire family trees complete with names and dates. Other bear simple signatures: "Sarah Birch in her seventh year". But embroidery wasn't solely the domain of women. Professional workshops staffed by men were responsible for much of the elaborate metal thread work used in fashion. The apprenticeship for a metal thread worker was eight years, and embroidery was viewed as a respected profession for men, particularly in the 17th century. Professional female embroiderers emerged later. The exhibition features a Morris and Co wall hanging from 1887, made by Catherine Holiday, recognised as one of Europe's most talented embroiderers. It's said that Morris trusted her artist aesthetic so implicitly that he even allowed her to choose her own colours and stitches.Conservator Kate Douglas works on an art deco evening cape from England, circa 1924.Credit: NGVIn the exhibition, many works will be displayed in cases that suspend them above mirrors – the reverse sides reveal many threads in close to original condition, their colours bright and handiwork laid bare. In an age when so many 12-year-olds spend their days on iPads, the conservators harbour a secret hope that some youngsters might be inspired by the works to try their hand at embroidery. Not so much as a chance to step back in time, but as an opportunity to celebrate the seasons and their surrounds. To make strawberries, caterpillars and butterflies appear, below skies of cumulus clouds and brightly hued birds; a summer day captured in thread.
