Isn't it the life all of you, all young men, always lead?" she said, knitting her brows; and taking up the crochet work that was lying on the table, she began drawing the hook out of it, without looking at Vronsky.She held the work in her hands, but did not crochet, and looked at him with strange, shining, and hostile eyes. View in contextShe wore a long cloak of some rough, dark material and a crochet shawl over her head.When he lay in bed he seemed still to see her sitting in the corner of the railway carriage, with the white crochet shawl over her head. View in contextTom Holt can crochet beautifully, but he can't make a living for his family. View in contextDiana showed me a new fancy crochet stitch her aunt over at Carmody taught her. View in contextHer little airs and graces were much admired, so were her accomplishments, for besides her drawing, she could play twelve tunes, crochet, and read French without mispronouncing more than two-thirds of the words. View in contextShe crocheted fine edgings on the inexpensive knitted underwear she wore in winter.She crocheted yards of laces for her underwear, and made Battenberg in abundance for her table and for the bureau. View in contextKnitted mufflers are much more stylish than crocheted ones this winter. View in contextBut she told Anne how many yards of lace she had recently crocheted, and the kind of weather they were having in Avonlea, and how she intended to have her new dress made, and the way she felt when her head ached. View in contextI am a Jesuit, if you please to think so--a splitter of straws--a man of trifles and crochets and scruples--but you will humour me, I hope, in merciful consideration for my suspicious Italian character, and my uneasy Italian conscience." He bowed again, stepped back a few paces, and withdrew his conscience from our society as politely as he had introduced it. View in context
