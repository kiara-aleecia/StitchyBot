[23] because sizing is categorized by the diameter of the hook's shaft, a crafter aims to create stitches of a certain size in order to reach a particular gauge specified in a given pattern.

this is also termed the gauge.

the recommended gauge for a given ball of yarn can be found on the label that surrounds the skein when buying in stores.

[26] another terminological difference is known as tension (uk) and gauge (us).

north americans call this gauge, referring to the result of these adjustments; british crocheters speak of tension, which refers to the crafter's grip on the yarn while producing stitches.
