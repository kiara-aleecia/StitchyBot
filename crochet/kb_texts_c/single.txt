[12] an instruction book from 1846 describes shepherd or single crochet as what in current british usage is either called single crochet or slip-stitch crochet, with u.s. american terminology always using the latter (reserving single crochet for use as noted above).

[citation needed] taken with the synonymous labeling of shepherd's- and single crochet, and the similar equivalence of french- and double crochet, there is a strong suggestion that crochet is rooted both in tambour embroidery and shepherd's knitting, leading to thread and yarn crochet respectively; a distinction that is still made.

crocheters generally ensure that the yarn for a project comes from a single dye lot.

if insufficient yarn of a single dye lot is bought to complete a project, additional skeins of the same dye lot can sometimes be obtained from other yarn stores or online.

[citation needed] a single spun yarn may be crochet as is, or braided or plied with another.

the single yarns may be dyed separately before plying, or afterwards to give the yarn a uniform look.

rounds can also be created by working many stitches into a single loop.

the height of knitted and crocheted stitches is also different: a single crochet stitch is twice the height of a knit stitch in the same yarn size and comparable diameter tools, and a double crochet stitch is about four times the height of a knit stitch.

although this is true when comparing a single crochet swatch with a stockinette swatch, both made with the same size yarn and needle/hook, it is not necessarily true for crochet in general.

according to sources[30] claiming to have tested the 1/3 more yarn assertion, a single crochet stitch (sc) uses approximately the same amount of yarn as knit garter stitch, but more yarn than stockinette stitch.

any stitch using yarnovers uses less yarn than single crochet to produce the same amount of fabric.
