[citation needed] after world war ii, from the late 1940s until the early 1960s, there was a resurgence in interest in home crafts, particularly in the united states, with many new and imaginative crochet designs published for colorful doilies, potholders, and other home items, along with updates of earlier publications.

the craft remained primarily a homemaker's art until the late 1960s and early 1970s, when the new generation picked up on crochet and popularized granny squares, a motif worked in the round and incorporating bright colors.

[citation needed] crochet hook[edit] aluminium crochet hooks main article: crochet hook the crochet hook comes in many sizes and materials, such as bone, bamboo, aluminium, plastic, and steel.

[23] because sizing is categorized by the diameter of the hook's shaft, a crafter aims to create stitches of a certain size in order to reach a particular gauge specified in a given pattern.

crafters may have a preference for one type of hook material over another due to aesthetic appeal, yarn glide, or hand disorders such as arthritis, where bamboo or wood hooks are favored over metal for the perceived warmth and flexibility during use.

[citation needed] artisan-made hooks are often made of hand-turned woods, sometimes decorated with semi-precious stones or beads.

see : list of united states standard crochet hook and knitting needle sizes yarn[edit] main article: yarn a hank of wool yarn (center) is uncoiled into its basic loop.

[citation needed] a yarn's usefulness is judged by several factors, such as its loft (its ability to trap air), its resilience (elasticity under tension), its washability and colorfastness, its hand (its feel, particularly softness vs. scratchiness), its durability against abrasion, its resistance to pilling, its hairiness (fuzziness), its tendency to twist or untwist, its overall weight and drape, its blocking and felting qualities, its comfort (breathability, moisture absorption, wicking properties) and its appearance, which includes its color, sheen, smoothness and ornamental features.

[citation needed] the dyeing of yarns is a complex art.

international crochet terms and notations[edit] main article: list of crochet stitches some crochet symbols, abbreviations, and us/uk terms in the english-speaking crochet world, basic stitches have different names that vary by country.

in most crochet, the artisan usually has only one live stitch on the hook (with the exception being tunisian crochet), while a knitter keeps an entire row of stitches active simultaneously.

according to sources[30] claiming to have tested the 1/3 more yarn assertion, a single crochet stitch (sc) uses approximately the same amount of yarn as knit garter stitch, but more yarn than stockinette stitch.

[citation needed] standard crochet stitches like sc and dc also produce a thicker fabric, more like knit garter stitch.

this is part of why they use more yarn.

[34] this was an international effort to help during the particularly bad bushfire season which devastated local ecological systems.

a group started in 2005 to create crochet versions of coral reefs grew by 2022 to over 20,000 contributors in what became the crochet coral reef project.

margaret wertheim and christine wertheim of the institute for figuring created a travelling art installation of a coral reef using taimina's method.

local artists are encouraged to create their own "satellite reefs" to be included alongside the original display.

[37] as hyperbolic and mathematics-based crochet has become more popular, there have been several events highlighting work from various fiber artists.

[38] architecture[edit] in style in the technical arts, gottfried semper looks at the textile with great promise and historical precedent.

according to sources [ 30 ] claiming to have tested the 1 / 3 more yarn assertion , a single crochet stitch ( sc ) uses approximately the same amount of yarn as knit garter stitch , but more yarn than stockinette stitch .

[ citation needed ] standard crochet stitches like sc and dc also produce a thicker fabric , more like knit garter stitch .

this is part of why they use more yarn .

loom lore: march 2010 wednesday, march 24, 2010 granny-on-the-loom last june, i started exploring translating concentric crochet techniques on the knitting looms which resulted in several different coaster designs.

if i do, i'll update this post with a picture at the end.this particular design has gone through several versions.

one version was modified from the double heart pattern by althea burger and recently taught in loom class.

three hearts were made using green yarn following the double heart pattern and an i-cord stem was added.

crochet coral reef mixes handicrafts, environmentalism and feminism in 2005, newspapers were filled with articles about human-caused destruction of the great barrier reef, the world's largest coral reef system.

around 2005, scientists started finding that coral bleaching events, like in the great barrier reef (above), were due to ocean warming caused by humans what started 17 years ago as a way to draw attention to global warming caused by human activities has grown into quite possibly the world's largest collective art and science initiative: the crochet coral reef project.

along with the wertheim sisters, more than 20,000 participants — mostly women — around the world have spent countless hours crocheting millions of stitches, creating woolly corals and other undersea creatures that the sisters then join together in a large-scale and endlessly evolving collective art installation.

"so there's this lovely story, that underlying the making of these objects is both feminine handicraft but also knowledge about the foundations of geometry," said wertheim, who started crocheting with her sister in her early teens.

"just like there's no end to the life on earth — you know, there'll be creatures in a million years that we haven't even thought of now — and the crochet reef is like that, too, and we hadn't really expected that," wertheim said.

contributors to crochet coral reef are given a base pattern and encouraged to use their imagination community-based art contributed corals are combined into the satellite reefs, the crowdsourced element of crochet coral reef, yet another parallel to actual coral reefs, which are collective structures created by billions of individual coral polyps.

"we always envisioned it as a community project that would bring people together to make lovely installations of coral reefs and through crochet, which is a wonderfully expressive medium, and that the installations would be beautiful artworks that could help bring attention to global warming and the fact that it was real and happening now, not just some future nebulous, maybe in 100-years-time problem," wertheim said.

"lots of museums and institutions, galleries, etc., really want to do participatory projects which engage the audience directly rather than, say, having the audience just come to the museums to look at works by famous artists," she said.

while demand to show crochet coral reef has increased, as a community art project whose works are not sold and therefore generates no profit, its ongoing existence depends entirely upon funding — much like coral reefs themselves, wertheim explains.

but funding the upkeep of the corals is a hard thing to get anybody to step up to the plate to do ... they're not in the monetized system, and community art is a bit like that.

it's not within the monetary system of the art world."

the second (illustrated here) starts in a semi-open form (demi jour), where chain-stitch arches alternate with equally long segments of slip-stitch crochet, and closes with a star made with "double-crochet stitches" (dubbelde hekelsteek: double-crochet in british terminology; single-crochet in us).

this art has attained its highest degree of perfection in england, whence it has been transplanted to france and germany, and both countries, although unjustifiably, have claimed the invention.

schools to teach crocheting were started.

[citation needed] after world war ii, from the late 1940s until the early 1960s, there was a resurgence in interest in home crafts, particularly in the united states, with many new and imaginative crochet designs published for colorful doilies, potholders, and other home items, along with updates of earlier publications.

the craft remained primarily a homemaker's art until the late 1960s and early 1970s, when the new generation picked up on crochet and popularized granny squares, a motif worked in the round and incorporating bright colors.

[citation needed] crochet hook[edit] aluminium crochet hooks main article: crochet hook the crochet hook comes in many sizes and materials, such as bone, bamboo, aluminium, plastic, and steel.

[23] because sizing is categorized by the diameter of the hook's shaft, a crafter aims to create stitches of a certain size in order to reach a particular gauge specified in a given pattern.

crafters may have a preference for one type of hook material over another due to aesthetic appeal, yarn glide, or hand disorders such as arthritis, where bamboo or wood hooks are favored over metal for the perceived warmth and flexibility during use.

[citation needed] artisan-made hooks are often made of hand-turned woods, sometimes decorated with semi-precious stones or beads.

see : list of united states standard crochet hook and knitting needle sizes yarn[edit] main article: yarn a hank of wool yarn (center) is uncoiled into its basic loop.

[citation needed] a yarn's usefulness is judged by several factors, such as its loft (its ability to trap air), its resilience (elasticity under tension), its washability and colorfastness, its hand (its feel, particularly softness vs. scratchiness), its durability against abrasion, its resistance to pilling, its hairiness (fuzziness), its tendency to twist or untwist, its overall weight and drape, its blocking and felting qualities, its comfort (breathability, moisture absorption, wicking properties) and its appearance, which includes its color, sheen, smoothness and ornamental features.

[citation needed] the dyeing of yarns is a complex art.

international crochet terms and notations[edit] main article: list of crochet stitches some crochet symbols, abbreviations, and us/uk terms in the english-speaking crochet world, basic stitches have different names that vary by country.

in most crochet, the artisan usually has only one live stitch on the hook (with the exception being tunisian crochet), while a knitter keeps an entire row of stitches active simultaneously.

according to sources[30] claiming to have tested the 1/3 more yarn assertion, a single crochet stitch (sc) uses approximately the same amount of yarn as knit garter stitch, but more yarn than stockinette stitch.

[citation needed] standard crochet stitches like sc and dc also produce a thicker fabric, more like knit garter stitch.

this is part of why they use more yarn.

[34] this was an international effort to help during the particularly bad bushfire season which devastated local ecological systems.

a group started in 2005 to create crochet versions of coral reefs grew by 2022 to over 20,000 contributors in what became the crochet coral reef project.

margaret wertheim and christine wertheim of the institute for figuring created a travelling art installation of a coral reef using taimina's method.

local artists are encouraged to create their own "satellite reefs" to be included alongside the original display.

[37] as hyperbolic and mathematics-based crochet has become more popular, there have been several events highlighting work from various fiber artists.
