the key difference between crochet and knitting, beyond the implements used for their production, is that each stitch in crochet is completed before the next one is begun, while knitting keeps many stitches open at a time.

some variant forms of crochet, such as tunisian crochet and broomstick lace, do keep multiple crochet stitches open at a time.

[3] it was used in 17th-century french lace-making, where the term crochetage designated a stitch used to join separate pieces of lace.

[7] the first is "simple open crochet" (crochet simple ajour), a mesh of chain-stitch arches.

the second (illustrated here) starts in a semi-open form (demi jour), where chain-stitch arches alternate with equally long segments of slip-stitch crochet, and closes with a star made with "double-crochet stitches" (dubbelde hekelsteek: double-crochet in british terminology; single-crochet in us).

[12] an instruction book from 1846 describes shepherd or single crochet as what in current british usage is either called single crochet or slip-stitch crochet, with u.s. american terminology always using the latter (reserving single crochet for use as noted above).

the tip of the needle shown there is indistinguishable from that of a present-day inline crochet hook and the chain stitch separated from a cloth support is a fundamental element of the latter technique.

[16] shepherd's hook, 19th-century tapered hook, modern inline hook the strong taper of the shepherd's hook eases the production of slip-stitch crochet but is less amenable to stitches that require multiple loops on the hook at the same time.

[citation needed] the early instruction books make frequent reference to the alternative use of 'ivory, bone, or wooden hooks' and 'steel needles in a handle', as appropriate to the stitch being made.

shepherd's hooks are still being made for local slip-stitch crochet traditions.

crocheted laces in the new edwardian era, peaking between 1910 and 1920, became even more elaborate in texture and complicated stitching.

examples of such tools include cardboard cutouts, which can be used to make tassels, fringe, and many other items; a pom-pom circle, used to make pom-poms; a tape measure and a gauge measure, both used for measuring crocheted work and counting stitches; a row counter; and occasionally plastic rings, which are used for special projects.

[23] because sizing is categorized by the diameter of the hook's shaft, a crafter aims to create stitches of a certain size in order to reach a particular gauge specified in a given pattern.

if gauge is not reached with one hook, another is used until the stitches made are the needed size.

[citation needed] a hairpin loom is often used to create lacy and long stitches, known as hairpin lace.

while this is not in itself a hook, it is a device used in conjunction with a crochet hook to produce stitches.

the thickness or weight of the yarn is a significant factor in determining how many stitches and rows are required to cover a given area for a given stitch pattern.

hence, thicker yarns generally require fewer stitches, and therefore less time, to work up a given project.

the chain is either turned and worked in rows, or joined to the beginning of the row with a slip stitch and worked in rounds.

rounds can also be created by working many stitches into a single loop.

stitches are made by pulling one or more loops through each loop of the chain.

at any one time at the end of a stitch, there is only one loop left on the hook.

[citation needed] types of stitches[edit] indian crochet white tablecloth about 1970. there are six main types of basic stitches (the following description uses us crochet terminology which differs from the terminology used in the uk and europe).

chain stitch – the most basic of all stitches and used to begin most projects.

slip stitch – used to join chain stitch to form a ring.

single crochet stitch (called double crochet stitch in the uk) – easiest stitch to master half-double crochet stitch (called half treble stitch in the uk) – the 'in-between' stitch, sometimes called short double crochet in vintage publications double crochet stitch (called treble stitch in the uk) (yarn over once) – many uses for this unlimited use stitch treble (or triple) crochet stitch (called double treble stitch in the uk) (yarn over twice) while the horizontal distance covered by these basic stitches is the same, they differ in height and thickness.

[citation needed] the more advanced stitches are often combinations of these basic stitches, or are made by inserting the hook into the work in unusual locations.

more advanced stitches include the shell stitch, v stitch, spike stitch, afghan stitch, butterfly stitch, popcorn stitch, cluster stitch, and crocodile stitch.

international crochet terms and notations[edit] main article: list of crochet stitches some crochet symbols, abbreviations, and us/uk terms in the english-speaking crochet world, basic stitches have different names that vary by country.

crochet is traditionally worked off a written pattern in which stitches and placement are communicated using textual abbreviations.

individual crocheters work yarn with a loose or a tight hold and, if unmeasured, these differences can lead to significant size changes in finished garments that have the same number of stitches.

in order to control for this inconsistency, printed crochet instructions include a standard for the number of stitches across a standard swatch of fabric.

north americans call this gauge, referring to the result of these adjustments; british crocheters speak of tension, which refers to the crafter's grip on the yarn while producing stitches.

in most crochet, the artisan usually has only one live stitch on the hook (with the exception being tunisian crochet), while a knitter keeps an entire row of stitches active simultaneously.

dropped stitches, which can unravel a knitted fabric, rarely interfere with crochet work, due to a second structural difference between knitting and crochet.

in knitting, each stitch is supported by the corresponding stitch in the row above and it supports the corresponding stitch in the row below, whereas crochet stitches are only supported by and support the stitches on either side of it.

if a stitch in a finished crocheted item breaks, the stitches above and below remain intact, and because of the complex looping of each stitch, the stitches on either side are unlikely to come loose unless heavily stressed.

[citation needed] freeform crochet is a technique that can create interesting shapes in three dimensions because new stitches can be made independently of previous stitches almost anywhere in the crocheted piece.

knitting can be accomplished by machine, while many crochet stitches can only be crafted by hand.

the height of knitted and crocheted stitches is also different: a single crochet stitch is twice the height of a knit stitch in the same yarn size and comparable diameter tools, and a double crochet stitch is about four times the height of a knit stitch.

[28] slip stitch crochet is very similar to knitting.

each stitch in slip stitch crochet is formed the same way as a knit or purl stitch which is then bound off.

a person working in slip stitch crochet can follow a knitted pattern with knits, purls, and cables, and get a similar result.

tunisian crochet and slip stitch crochet can in some cases use less yarn than knitting for comparable pieces.

according to sources[30] claiming to have tested the 1/3 more yarn assertion, a single crochet stitch (sc) uses approximately the same amount of yarn as knit garter stitch, but more yarn than stockinette stitch.

any stitch using yarnovers uses less yarn than single crochet to produce the same amount of fabric.

cluster stitches, which are in fact multiple stitches worked together, will use the most length.

[citation needed] standard crochet stitches like sc and dc also produce a thicker fabric, more like knit garter stitch.

slip stitch can produce a fabric much like stockinette that is thinner and therefore uses less yarn.

[31] differences between crochet and knitting most crochet uses one hook and works upon one stitch at a time.

knitting uses two or more straight needles that carry multiple stitches.

[clarification needed] in section 53, he writes of the "loop stitch, or noeud coulant: a knot that, if untied, causes the whole system to unravel."

2yarn 6process 7types of stitches 8international crochet terms and notations 9differences from and similarities to knitting 10charity and activism 11mathematics and hyperbolic crochet 12architecture toggle architecture subsection 12 .

the key difference between crochet and knitting , beyond the implements used for their production , is that each stitch in crochet is completed before the next one is begun , while knitting keeps many stitches open at a time .

some variant forms of crochet , such as tunisian crochet and broomstick lace , do keep multiple crochet stitches open at a time .

[ 3 ] it was used in 17th - century french lace - making , where the term crochetage designated a stitch used to join separate pieces of lace .

[ 7 ] the first is " simple open crochet " ( crochet simple ajour ), a mesh of chain - stitch arches .

the second ( illustrated here ) starts in a semi - open form ( demi jour ), where chain - stitch arches alternate with equally long segments of slip - stitch crochet , and closes with a star made with " double - crochet stitches " ( dubbelde hekelsteek : double - crochet in british terminology ; single - crochet in us ).

[ 12 ] an instruction book from 1846 describes shepherd or single crochet as what in current british usage is either called single crochet or slip - stitch crochet , with u .

the tip of the needle shown there is indistinguishable from that of a present - day inline crochet hook and the chain stitch separated from a cloth support is a fundamental element of the latter technique .

[ 16 ] shepherd ' s hook , 19th - century tapered hook , modern inline hook the strong taper of the shepherd ' s hook eases the production of slip - stitch crochet but is less amenable to stitches that require multiple loops on the hook at the same time .

[ citation needed ] the early instruction books make frequent reference to the alternative use of ' ivory , bone , or wooden hooks ' and ' steel needles in a handle ', as appropriate to the stitch being made .

shepherd ' s hooks are still being made for local slip - stitch crochet traditions .

crocheted laces in the new edwardian era , peaking between 1910 and 1920 , became even more elaborate in texture and complicated stitching .

examples of such tools include cardboard cutouts , which can be used to make tassels , fringe , and many other items ; a pom - pom circle , used to make pom - poms ; a tape measure and a gauge measure , both used for measuring crocheted work and counting stitches ; a row counter ; and occasionally plastic rings , which are used for special projects .

[ 23 ] because sizing is categorized by the diameter of the hook ' s shaft , a crafter aims to create stitches of a certain size in order to reach a particular gauge specified in a given pattern .

if gauge is not reached with one hook , another is used until the stitches made are the needed size .

[ citation needed ] a hairpin loom is often used to create lacy and long stitches , known as hairpin lace .

while this is not in itself a hook , it is a device used in conjunction with a crochet hook to produce stitches .

the thickness or weight of the yarn is a significant factor in determining how many stitches and rows are required to cover a given area for a given stitch pattern .

hence , thicker yarns generally require fewer stitches , and therefore less time , to work up a given project .

the chain is either turned and worked in rows , or joined to the beginning of the row with a slip stitch and worked in rounds .

rounds can also be created by working many stitches into a single loop .

stitches are made by pulling one or more loops through each loop of the chain .

at any one time at the end of a stitch , there is only one loop left on the hook .

[ citation needed ] types of stitches [ edit ] indian crochet white tablecloth about 1970 .

there are six main types of basic stitches ( the following description uses us crochet terminology which differs from the terminology used in the uk and europe ).

chain stitch – the most basic of all stitches and used to begin most projects .

slip stitch – used to join chain stitch to form a ring .

single crochet stitch ( called double crochet stitch in the uk ) – easiest stitch to master half - double crochet stitch ( called half treble stitch in the uk ) – the ' in - between ' stitch , sometimes called short double crochet in vintage publications double crochet stitch ( called treble stitch in the uk ) ( yarn over once ) – many uses for this unlimited use stitch treble ( or triple ) crochet stitch ( called double treble stitch in the uk ) ( yarn over twice ) while the horizontal distance covered by these basic stitches is the same , they differ in height and thickness .

[ citation needed ] the more advanced stitches are often combinations of these basic stitches , or are made by inserting the hook into the work in unusual locations .

more advanced stitches include the shell stitch , v stitch , spike stitch , afghan stitch , butterfly stitch , popcorn stitch , cluster stitch , and crocodile stitch .

international crochet terms and notations [ edit ] main article : list of crochet stitches some crochet symbols , abbreviations , and us / uk terms in the english - speaking crochet world , basic stitches have different names that vary by country .

crochet is traditionally worked off a written pattern in which stitches and placement are communicated using textual abbreviations .

individual crocheters work yarn with a loose or a tight hold and , if unmeasured , these differences can lead to significant size changes in finished garments that have the same number of stitches .

in order to control for this inconsistency , printed crochet instructions include a standard for the number of stitches across a standard swatch of fabric .

north americans call this gauge , referring to the result of these adjustments ; british crocheters speak of tension , which refers to the crafter ' s grip on the yarn while producing stitches .

in most crochet , the artisan usually has only one live stitch on the hook ( with the exception being tunisian crochet ), while a knitter keeps an entire row of stitches active simultaneously .

dropped stitches , which can unravel a knitted fabric , rarely interfere with crochet work , due to a second structural difference between knitting and crochet .

in knitting , each stitch is supported by the corresponding stitch in the row above and it supports the corresponding stitch in the row below , whereas crochet stitches are only supported by and support the stitches on either side of it .

if a stitch in a finished crocheted item breaks , the stitches above and below remain intact , and because of the complex looping of each stitch , the stitches on either side are unlikely to come loose unless heavily stressed .

[ citation needed ] freeform crochet is a technique that can create interesting shapes in three dimensions because new stitches can be made independently of previous stitches almost anywhere in the crocheted piece .

knitting can be accomplished by machine , while many crochet stitches can only be crafted by hand .

the height of knitted and crocheted stitches is also different : a single crochet stitch is twice the height of a knit stitch in the same yarn size and comparable diameter tools , and a double crochet stitch is about four times the height of a knit stitch .

[ 28 ] slip stitch crochet is very similar to knitting .

each stitch in slip stitch crochet is formed the same way as a knit or purl stitch which is then bound off .

a person working in slip stitch crochet can follow a knitted pattern with knits , purls , and cables , and get a similar result .

tunisian crochet and slip stitch crochet can in some cases use less yarn than knitting for comparable pieces .

according to sources [ 30 ] claiming to have tested the 1 / 3 more yarn assertion , a single crochet stitch ( sc ) uses approximately the same amount of yarn as knit garter stitch , but more yarn than stockinette stitch .

any stitch using yarnovers uses less yarn than single crochet to produce the same amount of fabric .

cluster stitches , which are in fact multiple stitches worked together , will use the most length .

[ citation needed ] standard crochet stitches like sc and dc also produce a thicker fabric , more like knit garter stitch .

slip stitch can produce a fabric much like stockinette that is thinner and therefore uses less yarn .

[ 31 ] differences between crochet and knitting most crochet uses one hook and works upon one stitch at a time .

knitting uses two or more straight needles that carry multiple stitches .

[ clarification needed ] in section 53 , he writes of the " loop stitch , or noeud coulant : a knot that , if untied , causes the whole system to unravel ."

all of these designs just mimicked crochet stitches, but each one took me a little closer to what i was trying to achieve - to translate actual crochet stitches on the knitting looms.

all this resulted in the granny's rose square and a new technique i fondly call "loomchet" was born.when i first completed the granny's rose, which produced actual crochet stitches on the knitting looms, i had hoped the tutorial would be ready by last september.

as stated in the tutorial:this tutorial will show you how to make a simple granny square by incorporating two pegs on the knifty knitter looms to produce crochet stitches.

word of warning, like any new technique, the two peg stitch technique is a bit fiddly, but the results are well worth the effort.for best results, gather your supplies and find a quiet spot, then work through it as you read the tutorial.

then stitch them all together and in less than 30 minutes you have a cute little two & one-half inch shamrock.

it is made from the center out using a little two row loomer's magic circle (lmc) and 6 stitch i-cords worked into the bind off to form the leaves & stem.

these work up quickly, since no stitching is involved; however, they just aren't as pretty as the shamrocks.please comment if you enjoy this project.

some worked around the impossibly tight stitches & faulty techniques; a few others used it as a springboard to design their own basket; and some just gave up.

thank you, monica for being my impetus and test knitting the updated basket.the new design is similar to the old one, but different techniques and stitches are used to accomplish what i was trying to do in the original basket: scalloped base & rim with a slight taper from the top to the bottom.

however, the double e-wrap knit stitches that are used on the basket sides are so dense that you may find the liner is not necessary.

the later has an additional e-wrap row to allow ease in weaving the ribbon through the stitches.when i was making the pictures of the new baskets, i only had a few jellybeans on hand and didn't have any bunny peeps to add to the basket for decoration, so i created some tiny little bunnies and eggs.

the key difference between crochet and knitting, beyond the implements used for their production, is that each stitch in crochet is completed before the next one is begun, while knitting keeps many stitches open at a time.

some variant forms of crochet, such as tunisian crochet and broomstick lace, do keep multiple crochet stitches open at a time.

[3] it was used in 17th-century french lace-making, where the term crochetage designated a stitch used to join separate pieces of lace.

[7] the first is "simple open crochet" (crochet simple ajour), a mesh of chain-stitch arches.

the second (illustrated here) starts in a semi-open form (demi jour), where chain-stitch arches alternate with equally long segments of slip-stitch crochet, and closes with a star made with "double-crochet stitches" (dubbelde hekelsteek: double-crochet in british terminology; single-crochet in us).

[12] an instruction book from 1846 describes shepherd or single crochet as what in current british usage is either called single crochet or slip-stitch crochet, with u.s. american terminology always using the latter (reserving single crochet for use as noted above).

the tip of the needle shown there is indistinguishable from that of a present-day inline crochet hook and the chain stitch separated from a cloth support is a fundamental element of the latter technique.

[16] shepherd's hook, 19th-century tapered hook, modern inline hook the strong taper of the shepherd's hook eases the production of slip-stitch crochet but is less amenable to stitches that require multiple loops on the hook at the same time.

[citation needed] the early instruction books make frequent reference to the alternative use of 'ivory, bone, or wooden hooks' and 'steel needles in a handle', as appropriate to the stitch being made.

shepherd's hooks are still being made for local slip-stitch crochet traditions.

crocheted laces in the new edwardian era, peaking between 1910 and 1920, became even more elaborate in texture and complicated stitching.

examples of such tools include cardboard cutouts, which can be used to make tassels, fringe, and many other items; a pom-pom circle, used to make pom-poms; a tape measure and a gauge measure, both used for measuring crocheted work and counting stitches; a row counter; and occasionally plastic rings, which are used for special projects.

[23] because sizing is categorized by the diameter of the hook's shaft, a crafter aims to create stitches of a certain size in order to reach a particular gauge specified in a given pattern.

if gauge is not reached with one hook, another is used until the stitches made are the needed size.

[citation needed] a hairpin loom is often used to create lacy and long stitches, known as hairpin lace.

while this is not in itself a hook, it is a device used in conjunction with a crochet hook to produce stitches.

the thickness or weight of the yarn is a significant factor in determining how many stitches and rows are required to cover a given area for a given stitch pattern.

hence, thicker yarns generally require fewer stitches, and therefore less time, to work up a given project.

the chain is either turned and worked in rows, or joined to the beginning of the row with a slip stitch and worked in rounds.

rounds can also be created by working many stitches into a single loop.

stitches are made by pulling one or more loops through each loop of the chain.

at any one time at the end of a stitch, there is only one loop left on the hook.

[citation needed] types of stitches[edit] indian crochet white tablecloth about 1970. there are six main types of basic stitches (the following description uses us crochet terminology which differs from the terminology used in the uk and europe).

chain stitch – the most basic of all stitches and used to begin most projects.

slip stitch – used to join chain stitch to form a ring.

single crochet stitch (called double crochet stitch in the uk) – easiest stitch to master half-double crochet stitch (called half treble stitch in the uk) – the 'in-between' stitch, sometimes called short double crochet in vintage publications double crochet stitch (called treble stitch in the uk) (yarn over once) – many uses for this unlimited use stitch treble (or triple) crochet stitch (called double treble stitch in the uk) (yarn over twice) while the horizontal distance covered by these basic stitches is the same, they differ in height and thickness.

[citation needed] the more advanced stitches are often combinations of these basic stitches, or are made by inserting the hook into the work in unusual locations.

more advanced stitches include the shell stitch, v stitch, spike stitch, afghan stitch, butterfly stitch, popcorn stitch, cluster stitch, and crocodile stitch.

international crochet terms and notations[edit] main article: list of crochet stitches some crochet symbols, abbreviations, and us/uk terms in the english-speaking crochet world, basic stitches have different names that vary by country.

crochet is traditionally worked off a written pattern in which stitches and placement are communicated using textual abbreviations.

individual crocheters work yarn with a loose or a tight hold and, if unmeasured, these differences can lead to significant size changes in finished garments that have the same number of stitches.

in order to control for this inconsistency, printed crochet instructions include a standard for the number of stitches across a standard swatch of fabric.

north americans call this gauge, referring to the result of these adjustments; british crocheters speak of tension, which refers to the crafter's grip on the yarn while producing stitches.

in most crochet, the artisan usually has only one live stitch on the hook (with the exception being tunisian crochet), while a knitter keeps an entire row of stitches active simultaneously.

dropped stitches, which can unravel a knitted fabric, rarely interfere with crochet work, due to a second structural difference between knitting and crochet.

in knitting, each stitch is supported by the corresponding stitch in the row above and it supports the corresponding stitch in the row below, whereas crochet stitches are only supported by and support the stitches on either side of it.

if a stitch in a finished crocheted item breaks, the stitches above and below remain intact, and because of the complex looping of each stitch, the stitches on either side are unlikely to come loose unless heavily stressed.

[citation needed] freeform crochet is a technique that can create interesting shapes in three dimensions because new stitches can be made independently of previous stitches almost anywhere in the crocheted piece.

knitting can be accomplished by machine, while many crochet stitches can only be crafted by hand.

the height of knitted and crocheted stitches is also different: a single crochet stitch is twice the height of a knit stitch in the same yarn size and comparable diameter tools, and a double crochet stitch is about four times the height of a knit stitch.

[28] slip stitch crochet is very similar to knitting.

each stitch in slip stitch crochet is formed the same way as a knit or purl stitch which is then bound off.

a person working in slip stitch crochet can follow a knitted pattern with knits, purls, and cables, and get a similar result.

tunisian crochet and slip stitch crochet can in some cases use less yarn than knitting for comparable pieces.

according to sources[30] claiming to have tested the 1/3 more yarn assertion, a single crochet stitch (sc) uses approximately the same amount of yarn as knit garter stitch, but more yarn than stockinette stitch.

any stitch using yarnovers uses less yarn than single crochet to produce the same amount of fabric.

cluster stitches, which are in fact multiple stitches worked together, will use the most length.

[citation needed] standard crochet stitches like sc and dc also produce a thicker fabric, more like knit garter stitch.

slip stitch can produce a fabric much like stockinette that is thinner and therefore uses less yarn.

[31] differences between crochet and knitting most crochet uses one hook and works upon one stitch at a time.

knitting uses two or more straight needles that carry multiple stitches.

[clarification needed] in section 53, he writes of the "loop stitch, or noeud coulant: a knot that, if untied, causes the whole system to unravel."
