crochet (english: /kroʊˈʃeɪ/;[1] french: [kʁɔʃɛ][2]) is a process of creating textiles by using a crochet hook to interlock loops of yarn, thread, or strands of other materials.

[6] earlier work identified as crochet was commonly made by nålebinding, a different looped yarn technique.

the earliest dated reference in english to garments made of cloth produced by looping yarn with a hook—shepherd's knitting—is in the memoirs of a highland lady by elizabeth grant (1797–1830).

[9] nonetheless, the 1833 volume of penélopé describes and illustrates a shepherd's hook, and recommends its use for crochet with coarser yarn.

early yarn hooks were also continuously tapered but gradually enough to accommodate multiple loops.

[citation needed] taken with the synonymous labeling of shepherd's- and single crochet, and the similar equivalence of french- and double crochet, there is a strong suggestion that crochet is rooted both in tambour embroidery and shepherd's knitting, leading to thread and yarn crochet respectively; a distinction that is still made.

these patterns called for thicker threads and yarns than in earlier patterns and included variegated colors.

materials[edit] basic materials required for crochet are a hook and some type of material that will be crocheted, most commonly yarn or thread.

yarn, one of the most commonly used materials for crocheting, has varying weights which need to be taken into consideration when following patterns.

in recent years, yarn selections have moved beyond synthetic and plant and animal-based fibers to include bamboo, qiviut, hemp, and banana stalks, to name a few.

crafters may have a preference for one type of hook material over another due to aesthetic appeal, yarn glide, or hand disorders such as arthritis, where bamboo or wood hooks are favored over metal for the perceived warmth and flexibility during use.

see : list of united states standard crochet hook and knitting needle sizes yarn[edit] main article: yarn a hank of wool yarn (center) is uncoiled into its basic loop.

crocheting from a normal hank directly is likely to tangle the yarn, producing snarls.

yarn for crochet is usually sold as balls, or skeins (hanks), although it may also be wound on spools or cones.

skeins and balls are generally sold with a yarn band, a label that describes the yarn's weight, length, dye lot, fiber content, washing instructions, suggested needle size, likely gauge, etc.

it is a common practice to save the yarn band for future reference, especially if additional skeins must be purchased.

crocheters generally ensure that the yarn for a project comes from a single dye lot.

if insufficient yarn of a single dye lot is bought to complete a project, additional skeins of the same dye lot can sometimes be obtained from other yarn stores or online.

the thickness or weight of the yarn is a significant factor in determining how many stitches and rows are required to cover a given area for a given stitch pattern.

thicker yarns generally require large-diameter crochet hooks, whereas thinner yarns may be crocheted with thick or thin hooks.

hence, thicker yarns generally require fewer stitches, and therefore less time, to work up a given project.

the recommended gauge for a given ball of yarn can be found on the label that surrounds the skein when buying in stores.

patterns and motifs are coarser with thicker yarns and produce bold visual effects, whereas thinner yarns are best for refined or delicate pattern-work.

yarns are standardly grouped by thickness into six categories: superfine, fine, light, medium, bulky and superbulky.

transformation of a hank of lavender silk yarn (top) into a ball in which the yarn emerges from the center (bottom).

using the latter is better for needlework, since the yarn is much less likely to tangle.

before use, hanks are wound into balls in which the yarn emerges from the center, making crocheting easier by preventing the yarn from becoming easily tangled.

[citation needed] a yarn's usefulness is judged by several factors, such as its loft (its ability to trap air), its resilience (elasticity under tension), its washability and colorfastness, its hand (its feel, particularly softness vs. scratchiness), its durability against abrasion, its resistance to pilling, its hairiness (fuzziness), its tendency to twist or untwist, its overall weight and drape, its blocking and felting qualities, its comfort (breathability, moisture absorption, wicking properties) and its appearance, which includes its color, sheen, smoothness and ornamental features.

desirable properties may vary for different projects, so there is no one "best" yarn.

the two possible twists of yarn although crochet may be done with ribbons, metal wire or more exotic filaments, most yarns are made by spinning fibers.

in spinning, the fibers are twisted so that the yarn resists breaking under tension; the twisting may be done in either direction, resulting in a z-twist or s-twist yarn.

if the fibers are first aligned by combing them and the spinner uses a worsted type drafting method such as the short forward draw, the yarn is smoother and called a worsted; by contrast, if the fibers are carded but not combed and the spinner uses a woolen drafting method such as the long backward draw, the yarn is fuzzier and called woolen-spun.

the fibers making up a yarn may be continuous filament fibers such as silk and many synthetics, or they may be staples (fibers of an average length, typically a few inches); naturally filament fibers are sometimes cut up into staples before spinning.

the strength of the spun yarn against breaking is determined by the amount of twist, the length of the fibers and the thickness of the yarn.

in general, yarns become stronger with more twist (also called worst), longer fibers and thicker yarns (more fibers); for example, thinner yarns require more twist than do thicker yarns to resist breaking under tension.

the thickness of the yarn may vary along its length; a slub is a much thicker section in which a mass of fibers is incorporated into the yarn.

it is also common to blend different fibers in the yarn, e.g., 85% alpaca and 15% silk.

[citation needed] a single spun yarn may be crochet as is, or braided or plied with another.

in plying, two or more yarns are spun together, almost always in the opposite sense from which they were spun individually; for example, two z-twist yarns are usually plied with an s-twist.

the opposing twist relieves some of the yarns' tendency to curl up and produces a thicker, balanced yarn.

plied yarns may themselves be plied together, producing cabled yarns or multi-stranded yarns.

sometimes, the yarns being plied are fed at different rates, so that one yarn loops around the other, as in bouclé.

the single yarns may be dyed separately before plying, or afterwards to give the yarn a uniform look.

[citation needed] the dyeing of yarns is a complex art.

yarns need not be dyed; or they may be dyed one color, or a great variety of colors.

dyeing may be done industrially, by hand or even hand-painted onto the yarn.

the color-scheme of a yarn is sometimes called its colorway.

variegated yarns can produce interesting visual effects, such as diagonal stripes.

crochet tablecloth, kolkata, west bengal, india crocheted fabric is begun by placing a slip-knot loop on the hook (though other methods, such as a magic ring or simple folding over of the yarn may be used), pulling another loop through the first loop, and repeating this process to create a chain of a suitable length.

in the united states, crochet terminology and sizing guidelines, as well as standards for yarn and hook labeling, are primarily regulated by the craft yarn council.

individual crocheters work yarn with a loose or a tight hold and, if unmeasured, these differences can lead to significant size changes in finished garments that have the same number of stitches.

north americans call this gauge, referring to the result of these adjustments; british crocheters speak of tension, which refers to the crafter's grip on the yarn while producing stitches.

the height of knitted and crocheted stitches is also different: a single crochet stitch is twice the height of a knit stitch in the same yarn size and comparable diameter tools, and a double crochet stitch is about four times the height of a knit stitch.

[29] it is a common perception that crochet produces a thicker fabric than knitting, tends to have less "give" than knitted fabric, and uses approximately a third more yarn for a comparable project than knitted items.

although this is true when comparing a single crochet swatch with a stockinette swatch, both made with the same size yarn and needle/hook, it is not necessarily true for crochet in general.

most crochet uses far less than 1/3 more yarn than knitting for comparable pieces, and a crocheter can get similar feel and drape to knitting by using a larger hook or thinner yarn.

tunisian crochet and slip stitch crochet can in some cases use less yarn than knitting for comparable pieces.

according to sources[30] claiming to have tested the 1/3 more yarn assertion, a single crochet stitch (sc) uses approximately the same amount of yarn as knit garter stitch, but more yarn than stockinette stitch.

any stitch using yarnovers uses less yarn than single crochet to produce the same amount of fabric.

this is part of why they use more yarn.

slip stitch can produce a fabric much like stockinette that is thinner and therefore uses less yarn.

any yarn can be either knitted or crocheted, provided needles or hooks of the correct size are used, but the cord's properties should be taken into account.

for example, lofty, thick woolen yarns tend to function better when knitted, which does not crush their airy structure, while thin and tightly spun yarn helps to achieve the firm texture required for amigurumi crochet.

she is part of a group of yarn graffiti-artists called the souter stormers, who beautify their local town in scotland.

[citation needed] a yarn's usefulness is judged by several factors, such as its loft (its ability to trap air), its resilience (elasticity under tension), its washability and colorfastness, its hand (its feel, particularly softness vs. scratchiness), its durability against abrasion, its resistance to pilling, its hairiness (fuzziness), its tendency to twist or untwist, its overall weight and drape, its blocking and felting qualities, its comfort (breathability, moisture absorption, wicking properties) and its appearance, which includes its color, sheen, smoothness and ornamental features.

desirable properties may vary for different projects, so there is no one "best" yarn.

the two possible twists of yarn although crochet may be done with ribbons, metal wire or more exotic filaments, most yarns are made by spinning fibers.

in spinning, the fibers are twisted so that the yarn resists breaking under tension; the twisting may be done in either direction, resulting in a z-twist or s-twist yarn.

if the fibers are first aligned by combing them and the spinner uses a worsted type drafting method such as the short forward draw, the yarn is smoother and called a worsted; by contrast, if the fibers are carded but not combed and the spinner uses a woolen drafting method such as the long backward draw, the yarn is fuzzier and called woolen-spun.

the fibers making up a yarn may be continuous filament fibers such as silk and many synthetics, or they may be staples (fibers of an average length, typically a few inches); naturally filament fibers are sometimes cut up into staples before spinning.

the strength of the spun yarn against breaking is determined by the amount of twist, the length of the fibers and the thickness of the yarn.

in general, yarns become stronger with more twist (also called worst), longer fibers and thicker yarns (more fibers); for example, thinner yarns require more twist than do thicker yarns to resist breaking under tension.

the thickness of the yarn may vary along its length; a slub is a much thicker section in which a mass of fibers is incorporated into the yarn.

it is also common to blend different fibers in the yarn, e.g., 85% alpaca and 15% silk.

[citation needed] a single spun yarn may be crochet as is, or braided or plied with another.

in plying, two or more yarns are spun together, almost always in the opposite sense from which they were spun individually; for example, two z-twist yarns are usually plied with an s-twist.

the opposing twist relieves some of the yarns' tendency to curl up and produces a thicker, balanced yarn.

plied yarns may themselves be plied together, producing cabled yarns or multi-stranded yarns.

sometimes, the yarns being plied are fed at different rates, so that one yarn loops around the other, as in bouclé.

the single yarns may be dyed separately before plying, or afterwards to give the yarn a uniform look.

[citation needed] the dyeing of yarns is a complex art.

yarns need not be dyed; or they may be dyed one color, or a great variety of colors.

dyeing may be done industrially, by hand or even hand-painted onto the yarn.

the color-scheme of a yarn is sometimes called its colorway.

variegated yarns can produce interesting visual effects, such as diagonal stripes.

in the united states, crochet terminology and sizing guidelines, as well as standards for yarn and hook labeling, are primarily regulated by the craft yarn council.

individual crocheters work yarn with a loose or a tight hold and, if unmeasured, these differences can lead to significant size changes in finished garments that have the same number of stitches.

north americans call this gauge, referring to the result of these adjustments; british crocheters speak of tension, which refers to the crafter's grip on the yarn while producing stitches.

the height of knitted and crocheted stitches is also different: a single crochet stitch is twice the height of a knit stitch in the same yarn size and comparable diameter tools, and a double crochet stitch is about four times the height of a knit stitch.

[29] it is a common perception that crochet produces a thicker fabric than knitting, tends to have less "give" than knitted fabric, and uses approximately a third more yarn for a comparable project than knitted items.

although this is true when comparing a single crochet swatch with a stockinette swatch, both made with the same size yarn and needle/hook, it is not necessarily true for crochet in general.

most crochet uses far less than 1/3 more yarn than knitting for comparable pieces, and a crocheter can get similar feel and drape to knitting by using a larger hook or thinner yarn.

tunisian crochet and slip stitch crochet can in some cases use less yarn than knitting for comparable pieces.

according to sources[30] claiming to have tested the 1/3 more yarn assertion, a single crochet stitch (sc) uses approximately the same amount of yarn as knit garter stitch, but more yarn than stockinette stitch.

any stitch using yarnovers uses less yarn than single crochet to produce the same amount of fabric.

this is part of why they use more yarn.

slip stitch can produce a fabric much like stockinette that is thinner and therefore uses less yarn.

any yarn can be either knitted or crocheted, provided needles or hooks of the correct size are used, but the cord's properties should be taken into account.

for example, lofty, thick woolen yarns tend to function better when knitted, which does not crush their airy structure, while thin and tightly spun yarn helps to achieve the firm texture required for amigurumi crochet.

crochet ( english : / kroʊˈʃeɪ /;[ 1 ] french : [ kʁɔʃɛ ][ 2 ]) is a process of creating textiles by using a crochet hook to interlock loops of yarn , thread , or strands of other materials .

[ 6 ] earlier work identified as crochet was commonly made by nålebinding , a different looped yarn technique .

the earliest dated reference in english to garments made of cloth produced by looping yarn with a hook — shepherd ' s knitting — is in the memoirs of a highland lady by elizabeth grant ( 1797 – 1830 ).

[ 9 ] nonetheless , the 1833 volume of penélopé describes and illustrates a shepherd ' s hook , and recommends its use for crochet with coarser yarn .

early yarn hooks were also continuously tapered but gradually enough to accommodate multiple loops .

[ citation needed ] taken with the synonymous labeling of shepherd ' s - and single crochet , and the similar equivalence of french - and double crochet , there is a strong suggestion that crochet is rooted both in tambour embroidery and shepherd ' s knitting , leading to thread and yarn crochet respectively ; a distinction that is still made .

these patterns called for thicker threads and yarns than in earlier patterns and included variegated colors .

detail on gold thread crochet in a mid - 20th century short jacket designed by sybil connolly although crochet underwent a subsequent decline in popularity , the early 21st century has seen a revival of interest in handcrafts and diy , as well as improvement of the quality and varieties of yarn .

materials [ edit ] basic materials required for crochet are a hook and some type of material that will be crocheted , most commonly yarn or thread .

yarn , one of the most commonly used materials for crocheting , has varying weights which need to be taken into consideration when following patterns .

in recent years , yarn selections have moved beyond synthetic and plant and animal - based fibers to include bamboo , qiviut , hemp , and banana stalks , to name a few .

crafters may have a preference for one type of hook material over another due to aesthetic appeal , yarn glide , or hand disorders such as arthritis , where bamboo or wood hooks are favored over metal for the perceived warmth and flexibility during use .

see : list of united states standard crochet hook and knitting needle sizes yarn [ edit ] main article : yarn a hank of wool yarn ( center ) is uncoiled into its basic loop .

crocheting from a normal hank directly is likely to tangle the yarn , producing snarls .

yarn for crochet is usually sold as balls , or skeins ( hanks ), although it may also be wound on spools or cones .

skeins and balls are generally sold with a yarn band , a label that describes the yarn ' s weight , length , dye lot , fiber content , washing instructions , suggested needle size , likely gauge , etc .

it is a common practice to save the yarn band for future reference , especially if additional skeins must be purchased .

crocheters generally ensure that the yarn for a project comes from a single dye lot .

if insufficient yarn of a single dye lot is bought to complete a project , additional skeins of the same dye lot can sometimes be obtained from other yarn stores or online .

the thickness or weight of the yarn is a significant factor in determining how many stitches and rows are required to cover a given area for a given stitch pattern .

thicker yarns generally require large - diameter crochet hooks , whereas thinner yarns may be crocheted with thick or thin hooks .

hence , thicker yarns generally require fewer stitches , and therefore less time , to work up a given project .

the recommended gauge for a given ball of yarn can be found on the label that surrounds the skein when buying in stores .

patterns and motifs are coarser with thicker yarns and produce bold visual effects , whereas thinner yarns are best for refined or delicate pattern - work .

yarns are standardly grouped by thickness into six categories : superfine , fine , light , medium , bulky and superbulky .

[6] earlier work identified as crochet was commonly made by nålebinding, a different looped yarn technique.

the earliest dated reference in english to garments made of cloth produced by looping yarn with a hook—shepherd's knitting—is in the memoirs of a highland lady by elizabeth grant (1797–1830).

[9] nonetheless, the 1833 volume of penélopé describes and illustrates a shepherd's hook, and recommends its use for crochet with coarser yarn.

early yarn hooks were also continuously tapered but gradually enough to accommodate multiple loops.

[citation needed] taken with the synonymous labeling of shepherd's- and single crochet, and the similar equivalence of french- and double crochet, there is a strong suggestion that crochet is rooted both in tambour embroidery and shepherd's knitting, leading to thread and yarn crochet respectively; a distinction that is still made.

these patterns called for thicker threads and yarns than in earlier patterns and included variegated colors.

materials[edit] basic materials required for crochet are a hook and some type of material that will be crocheted, most commonly yarn or thread.

yarn, one of the most commonly used materials for crocheting, has varying weights which need to be taken into consideration when following patterns.

in recent years, yarn selections have moved beyond synthetic and plant and animal-based fibers to include bamboo, qiviut, hemp, and banana stalks, to name a few.

crafters may have a preference for one type of hook material over another due to aesthetic appeal, yarn glide, or hand disorders such as arthritis, where bamboo or wood hooks are favored over metal for the perceived warmth and flexibility during use.

see : list of united states standard crochet hook and knitting needle sizes yarn[edit] main article: yarn a hank of wool yarn (center) is uncoiled into its basic loop.

crocheting from a normal hank directly is likely to tangle the yarn, producing snarls.

yarn for crochet is usually sold as balls, or skeins (hanks), although it may also be wound on spools or cones.

skeins and balls are generally sold with a yarn band, a label that describes the yarn's weight, length, dye lot, fiber content, washing instructions, suggested needle size, likely gauge, etc.

it is a common practice to save the yarn band for future reference, especially if additional skeins must be purchased.

crocheters generally ensure that the yarn for a project comes from a single dye lot.

if insufficient yarn of a single dye lot is bought to complete a project, additional skeins of the same dye lot can sometimes be obtained from other yarn stores or online.

the thickness or weight of the yarn is a significant factor in determining how many stitches and rows are required to cover a given area for a given stitch pattern.

thicker yarns generally require large-diameter crochet hooks, whereas thinner yarns may be crocheted with thick or thin hooks.

hence, thicker yarns generally require fewer stitches, and therefore less time, to work up a given project.

the recommended gauge for a given ball of yarn can be found on the label that surrounds the skein when buying in stores.

patterns and motifs are coarser with thicker yarns and produce bold visual effects, whereas thinner yarns are best for refined or delicate pattern-work.

yarns are standardly grouped by thickness into six categories: superfine, fine, light, medium, bulky and superbulky.

using the latter is better for needlework, since the yarn is much less likely to tangle.

before use, hanks are wound into balls in which the yarn emerges from the center, making crocheting easier by preventing the yarn from becoming easily tangled.

[citation needed] a yarn's usefulness is judged by several factors, such as its loft (its ability to trap air), its resilience (elasticity under tension), its washability and colorfastness, its hand (its feel, particularly softness vs. scratchiness), its durability against abrasion, its resistance to pilling, its hairiness (fuzziness), its tendency to twist or untwist, its overall weight and drape, its blocking and felting qualities, its comfort (breathability, moisture absorption, wicking properties) and its appearance, which includes its color, sheen, smoothness and ornamental features.

desirable properties may vary for different projects, so there is no one "best" yarn.

the two possible twists of yarn although crochet may be done with ribbons, metal wire or more exotic filaments, most yarns are made by spinning fibers.

in spinning, the fibers are twisted so that the yarn resists breaking under tension; the twisting may be done in either direction, resulting in a z-twist or s-twist yarn.

if the fibers are first aligned by combing them and the spinner uses a worsted type drafting method such as the short forward draw, the yarn is smoother and called a worsted; by contrast, if the fibers are carded but not combed and the spinner uses a woolen drafting method such as the long backward draw, the yarn is fuzzier and called woolen-spun.

the fibers making up a yarn may be continuous filament fibers such as silk and many synthetics, or they may be staples (fibers of an average length, typically a few inches); naturally filament fibers are sometimes cut up into staples before spinning.

the strength of the spun yarn against breaking is determined by the amount of twist, the length of the fibers and the thickness of the yarn.

in general, yarns become stronger with more twist (also called worst), longer fibers and thicker yarns (more fibers); for example, thinner yarns require more twist than do thicker yarns to resist breaking under tension.

the thickness of the yarn may vary along its length; a slub is a much thicker section in which a mass of fibers is incorporated into the yarn.

it is also common to blend different fibers in the yarn, e.g., 85% alpaca and 15% silk.

[citation needed] a single spun yarn may be crochet as is, or braided or plied with another.

in plying, two or more yarns are spun together, almost always in the opposite sense from which they were spun individually; for example, two z-twist yarns are usually plied with an s-twist.

the opposing twist relieves some of the yarns' tendency to curl up and produces a thicker, balanced yarn.

plied yarns may themselves be plied together, producing cabled yarns or multi-stranded yarns.

sometimes, the yarns being plied are fed at different rates, so that one yarn loops around the other, as in bouclé.

the single yarns may be dyed separately before plying, or afterwards to give the yarn a uniform look.

[citation needed] the dyeing of yarns is a complex art.

yarns need not be dyed; or they may be dyed one color, or a great variety of colors.

dyeing may be done industrially, by hand or even hand-painted onto the yarn.

the color-scheme of a yarn is sometimes called its colorway.

variegated yarns can produce interesting visual effects, such as diagonal stripes.

single crochet stitch (called double crochet stitch in the uk) – easiest stitch to master half-double crochet stitch (called half treble stitch in the uk) – the 'in-between' stitch, sometimes called short double crochet in vintage publications double crochet stitch (called treble stitch in the uk) (yarn over once) – many uses for this unlimited use stitch treble (or triple) crochet stitch (called double treble stitch in the uk) (yarn over twice) while the horizontal distance covered by these basic stitches is the same, they differ in height and thickness.

in the united states, crochet terminology and sizing guidelines, as well as standards for yarn and hook labeling, are primarily regulated by the craft yarn council.

individual crocheters work yarn with a loose or a tight hold and, if unmeasured, these differences can lead to significant size changes in finished garments that have the same number of stitches.

north americans call this gauge, referring to the result of these adjustments; british crocheters speak of tension, which refers to the crafter's grip on the yarn while producing stitches.

the height of knitted and crocheted stitches is also different: a single crochet stitch is twice the height of a knit stitch in the same yarn size and comparable diameter tools, and a double crochet stitch is about four times the height of a knit stitch.

[29] it is a common perception that crochet produces a thicker fabric than knitting, tends to have less "give" than knitted fabric, and uses approximately a third more yarn for a comparable project than knitted items.

although this is true when comparing a single crochet swatch with a stockinette swatch, both made with the same size yarn and needle/hook, it is not necessarily true for crochet in general.

most crochet uses far less than 1/3 more yarn than knitting for comparable pieces, and a crocheter can get similar feel and drape to knitting by using a larger hook or thinner yarn.

tunisian crochet and slip stitch crochet can in some cases use less yarn than knitting for comparable pieces.

according to sources[30] claiming to have tested the 1/3 more yarn assertion, a single crochet stitch (sc) uses approximately the same amount of yarn as knit garter stitch, but more yarn than stockinette stitch.

any stitch using yarnovers uses less yarn than single crochet to produce the same amount of fabric.

this is part of why they use more yarn.

slip stitch can produce a fabric much like stockinette that is thinner and therefore uses less yarn.

any yarn can be either knitted or crocheted, provided needles or hooks of the correct size are used, but the cord's properties should be taken into account.

for example, lofty, thick woolen yarns tend to function better when knitted, which does not crush their airy structure, while thin and tightly spun yarn helps to achieve the firm texture required for amigurumi crochet.

[39] yarn bombers sometimes target existing pieces of graffiti for beautification.

[40] in september 2015, grace brett was named "the world's oldest yarn bomber".

she is part of a group of yarn graffiti-artists called the souter stormers, who beautify their local town in scotland.
